<Update label="Discord Social SDK Release 1.6.12170" description="2025-10-15" tags={["Discord Social SDK"]}>
  A new release of the Discord Social SDK is now available, with the following updates:

  ## New Features

  This small update to v1.6 adds some highly requested features from our partners. We found some time to sneak them in…

  - You can now provide custom art to display as a banner image in game invites that appear in Discord. This is done one
    of two ways:
      - By specifying a URL or an `asset key` to an image in the `activity.assets.inviteCoverImage` parameter when
        calling `Client::UpdateRichPresence`. This method even affords you the ability to set a unique image
        on each invite if you want!
      - By uploading cover image art in the `Rich Presence` tab in the Developer Portal for your Application. Note: This
        will be used as the fallback image if you don't specify one via `activity.assets.inviteCoverImage`
  - It's now possible to customize the displayed name for your Application in Discord's Rich Presence. To do so, set
    the `activity.name` parameter when calling [`Client::UpdateRichPresence`]
  - Added support for Microsoft Xbox GDK version 2025.04
  - Fixed a crash when calling [`Client::GetUserGuilds`] on iOS devices
</Update>

<Update label="Introducing the File Upload component in Modals" description="2025-10-15" tags={["Interactions", "Components"]}>
  Have you ever wanted to collect more than text from a user through a modal? With the new [**File Upload**](/developers/docs/components/reference#file-upload) component you can! You can specify a min and max number of files accepted between 0 and 10, and if uploading files within that limit is required before submitting. Any file types are accepted, and the max file size is based on the user's upload limit in that channel.

  #### The New Component:

  - [**File Upload**](/developers/docs/components/reference#file-upload)

  #### Developer Resources

<Update label="Discord Social SDK Release 1.6" description="2025-09-26" tags={["Discord Social SDK"]}>
  A new release of the Discord Social SDK is now available, with the following updates:

  ### ✨ New Features

  - When calling [`Client::GetGuildChannels`], channels are now sorted by their `position` field, which matches how they are sorted in the Discord client.
  - Messages received via the Social SDK, no longer create notifications in a Discord client for the same user, to avoid double notification on the same machine.

  **This release adds features to support upcoming Discord experiments that will enhance how games integrate with user profiles and authentication:**

  - **Game Profile Integration**: New functionality to display game data on Discord user profiles. This includes `UserApplicationProfile` support with two new methods: `Client::GetUserApplicationProfiles` and `Client::GetUserApplicationProfilesNoLock` on the Users class, which retrieve game identity data from external authentication providers.
  - **In-Discord Authentication Flow**: Support for users to start account linking directly from Discord (rather than having to initiate it from within your game). Added [`Client::RegisterAuthorizeRequestCallback`] and [`Client::RemoveAuthorizeRequestCallback`] methods to handle authentication requests that originate from various Discord entry points. These functions support upcoming Discord client experiments that will be gradually rolled out to users over time.

  ### ⚠️ Deprecations

  This deprecation aims to improve consistence across the SDK's API surface as well as provide a safer implementation that has fewer edge cases and less potential for accidental misuse.

  - Deprecated [`Client::GetCurrentUser`] API in favor of [`Client::GetCurrentUserV2`] which returns optional values instead of potentially invalid handles.

  ### 🚀 Performance Improvements

  - This update implements caching capabilities for the [`Client::GetUserMessagesWithLimit`] function to avoid unnecessary remote API calls when sufficient messages are already cached locally.

  ### 🎤 Voice Communications Fixes and Improvements

  Fixes several critical bugs with the voice communications system, as well as improved overall reliability, and noise and echo suppression and cancellation.

  - Fixed an issue where voice calls would sometimes transition to `Disconnected` state instead of reconnecting properly after a network interruption.
  - Extended AGC2 (Automatic Gain Control 2) support to mobile platforms

  ### 🐛 General Stability and Bug Fixes

  Multiple general critical bugs that can cause crashes and panics. We highly recommend upgrading to 1.6 to avoid them in your game.

  - Fixed critical bug where activity party privacy wasn't properly set, causing "ask to join" to appear instead of "join" for public parties.
  - Fixed critical memory safety issue preventing connection objects from being deallocated during timer callbacks.
  - Fixed C# marshaling alignment bugs and double-free crashes.
  - Improved gateway resilience with fallback to generic URLs on zonal gateway failures.
  - Fixed WebSocket write-after-close errors preventing connection issues.

</Update>

<Update label="Adding More Modal Components!" description="2025-09-10" tags={["Interactions", "Components"]}>
  We've added more components to modals! All select menus (User, Role, Mentionable, Channel) are now fully supported in modals. In order to use a select menu in a modal, it must be placed inside a [Label](/developers/docs/components/reference#label) component. We've also added the [Text Display](/developers/docs/components/reference#text-display) component with markdown support as a top-level component in modals.

  #### Components Now Supported in Modals:

  - [**User Select**](/developers/docs/components/reference#user-select)
  - [**Role Select**](/developers/docs/components/reference#role-select)
  - [**Mentionable Select**](/developers/docs/components/reference#mentionable-select)
  - [**Channel Select**](/developers/docs/components/reference#channel-select)
  - [**Text Display**](/developers/docs/components/reference#text-display)

  #### Getting Started

<Update label="Banner, avatar, and bio can be set on modify current member" description="2025-09-10" tags={["HTTP API"]}>
  As of September 10, 2025, bots can set `banner`, `avatar`, and `bio` fields using the [modify current member](/developers/docs/resources/guild#modify-current-member) route.
</Update>

<Update label="Deprecating Non-E2EE Voice Calls" description="2025-09-02" tags={["Voice"]}>
  We started work on end-to-end encryption for Discord over two years ago to enhance our user privacy and security. With
  DAVE now supported across all platforms, we’re very close to making every call fully end-to-end encrypted.

  ### Developer Impact

  To support our long-term privacy goals, we will **only support E2EE calls starting on March 1st, 2026** for all audio 
  and video conversations in direct messages (DMs), group messages (GDMs), voice channels, and Go Live streams on 
  Discord. After that date, any client or application not updated for DAVE support will no longer be able to 
  participate in Discord calls.

  ### Implementing E2EE Voice

  For developers working with Discord's voice APIs, you can consult 
  [the updated voice documentation](/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections)
  and the implementation examples available in our [open-source repository](https://github.com/discord/libdave) as 
  well as [the protocol whitepaper](https://github.com/discord/dave-protocol). 

  The [Discord Developers community](https://discord.gg/discord-developers) is also a
  great place to find assistance and answers to any integration questions you may have.

  We're committed to making this transition as smooth as possible while delivering the enhanced privacy and security that 
  DAVE provides to all Discord users.
</Update>

<Update label="Discord Social SDK Release 1.5.11353" description="2025-08-28" tags={["Discord Social SDK"]}>
  A new release of the Discord Social SDK is now available, with the following updates:

  ### Unity Plugin

  - Fixed a crash primarily affecting low-end Android devices (those with armv7 architecture) in 
  [`Client::CreateOrJoinLobbyWithMetadata`]
  - Fixed a crash when passing large amounts of metadata in [`Client::CreateOrJoinLobbyWithMetadata`]

  The Discord Social SDK binaries are available for download in the Developer Portal after enabling the Discord Social SDK for your application.

</Update>

<Update label="Introducing New Modal Components!" description="2025-08-25" tags={["Interactions", "Components"]}>
  You asked for them, and now they're here! Modals are getting new components!!

  #### What's New

  We're introducing a new top-level [Label](/developers/docs/components/reference#label) component for modals that have a `label`, `description`, and can contain a Text Input or a String Select! You heard right, String Selects now work in modals!

  - String Selects now work in modals when placed inside a Label component
  - Text Inputs can also be used inside a Label component
  - When a Text Input is used in a Label component the `label` field on the Text Input is not allowed in favor of `label` on the Label component
  - ActionRow + TextInput is now deprecated in favor of the new Label component for better accessibility
  - The `required` field is now available on String Selects (defaults to true in modals, ignored in messages)
  - The `disabled` field on String Selects is not currently allowed in modals, and will trigger an error if used

  We've also documented [modal interaction responses](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-component-interaction-response-structures) and resolved objects for interactive components in each component's Examples section.

  #### New Layout Component

  - [**Label**](/developers/docs/components/reference#label) - A new top-level component that lets you add a title and description to your modal components!

  #### Updates to Modal Components

  - [**Text Input**](/developers/docs/components/reference#text-input) - Text Input can now be used in a [Label](/developers/docs/components/reference#label) 
  - [**String Select**](/developers/docs/components/reference#string-select) - String Selects can be used in modals! Place them in a [Label](/developers/docs/components/reference#label)

  #### Getting Started

  - [Using Modal Components](/developers/docs/components/using-modal-components) - Dive into creating a modal

  #### Developer Resources

<Update label="Pin Permission Split" description="2025-08-20" tags={["Breaking Changes", "HTTP API"]}>
[Pinning](/developers/docs/resources/message#pin-message) and [unpinning](/developers/docs/resources/message#unpin-message) messages now has its own [permission](/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permissions-bitwise-permission-flags). We split `PIN_MESSAGES` out of `MANAGE_MESSAGES` to give more granular control over who can pin messages in a channel. This is effective immediately for both users and apps. This change will be backwards compatible until January 12th 2026 when `MANAGE_MESSAGES` will no longer grant the ability to pin or unpin messages.
</Update>

<Update label="Discord Social SDK Release 1.5" description="2025-08-15" tags={["Discord Social SDK"]}>
  A new release of the Discord Social SDK is now available, with the following updates:

  ### **DM History Support**

  With the release of DM chat history this patch, the Social SDK can now fully support asynchronous player communication between individual players and in larger chat rooms. Players who go offline or background the game can come back to the history of the chat room and get caught up with what’s happening.

  - Added [`Client::GetUserMessageSummaries`] and [`Client::GetUserMessagesWithLimit`] to retrieve direct message history

  ### Rich Presence

  Rich Presence can now more accurately display the different types of activities a player might be engaged in. Specifically, the “Competing” status may be valuable for games that host tournaments, weekend brackets, or other competitive play. Also, when you receive game invites, you can now accept them cross-device; don’t miss the group forming even if you’re AFK.

  - Added support for additional activity types (Listening, Watching, Competing)
  - Added support for new clickable URL fields and additional user status customization
  - Support for server-to-server rich presence invites and gateway-based invite handling. This means an invite can be accepted on a different device and the [`Client::SetActivityInviteCreatedCallback`] will be invoked on connected SDK sessions.

  ### Linked Channels

  Linked channels are all about keeping groups of friends connected in and outside the game. You can now join a player to channel’s linked Discord server from in-game, helping them bridge that gap and stay connected with friends even when they stop playing.

  - Added [`Client::JoinLinkedLobbyGuild`] to allow members of linked
  lobbies to join the linked lobby's guild from in-game

  ### Android

  The many-step process of mobile account linking has been simplified for users with Discord installed by deep-linking into the Discord mobile app to authorize with your game

  - Implemented native authentication support
  - Fixed native authentication callback when activities are terminated
  - Added an experimental audio setting on Android to avoid setting the OS to voice comms mode when connected to a Bluetooth headset on Android. This may be used if you wish to avoid the transition to voice volume controls and other related changes when connected to Bluetooth. To enable this setting, pass a [`ClientCreateOptions`] when instantiating the client and set the `experimentalAndroidPreventCommsForBluetooth` flag

  ![Video showing off the account linking process in 1.4 vs 1.5 on Android](/images/1.4vs1.5.webp)

  ### iOS

  The many-step process of mobile account linking has been simplified for users with Discord installed by deep-linking into the Discord mobile app to authorize with your game

  - Added native authentication support
  - The experimental Game audio subsystem now makes use of the iOS 18.2+ echo canceller when available and falls back to Standard mode otherwise.

  ### Windows

  - Added ARM64 support

  ### Linux

  - Ensured glibc 2.31 compatibility

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed bug where [`Client::SetVoiceLogDir`] didn’t have any effect
  - Added better error event handling to distinguish server authorization errors from user cancellations
  - Fixed activity platform validation for console games
  - Fixed crash safety issues with [`Client::GetCurrentUser`] when the client is in an unexpected non-Ready state. Added [`Client::GetCurrentUserV2`] which explicitly returns an optional handle instead of dummy data in this situation. This issue also affected the Unity and Unreal versions of the SDK
  - Fixed [`Call::SetPTTActive`]

  ## Known Issues

  - When the network is disconnected temporarily, active Calls may sometimes enter the Disconnected state instead of reconnecting. If a Call reaches Disconnected state, you must end and rejoin the call to reconnect if desired.
  - For DM chat history
      - No SDK-side caching for [`Client::GetUserMessagesWithLimit`]
          - Every invocation of [`Client::GetUserMessagesWithLimit`] will directly query the backend rather than using local SDK-side caching. This may have performance implications, particularly under high-frequency usage.
      - Provisional account merge message retrieval
          - After a provisional account is merged into a full account, messages sent while the user was on the provisional account cannot be retrieved.
</Update>

<Update label="Introducing Rate Limit When Requesting All Guild Members" description="2025-08-14" tags={["Gateway"]}>
  We're introducing a change to the [Request Guild Members](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#request-guild-members) gateway opcode. 

  ### What's changing?

  We are implementing a rate limit on the [Request Guild Members](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#request-guild-members) opcode[.](https://takeb1nzyto.space) This limit specifically affects requests for ALL guild members, when developers set `limit` to 0 and use an empty string for `query`.

  <Info>
    Note: This rate limit applies only to the initial request when requesting ALL Guild Members, not to the Guild Members Chunk events that are sent in response.
  </Info>

  - **Rate Limit:** 1 request per guild per bot every 30 seconds
  - **Scope:** The limit applies per guild per bot (one bot can request members for different guilds within the 30-second window)
  - **Behavior:** Requests that exceed this limit will receive a [`RATE_LIMITED`](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#rate-limited) event as a response:

  ```js
  {
    "op": 0
    "t": "RATE_LIMITED",
    "d": {
      "opcode": 8,
      "retry_after": ...,
      "meta": {
        "guild_id": ...,
        "nonce": ...
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  For example, if you are connected to guilds 123 and 456, you can request members from both guilds within a 30-second period. However, you cannot make a second request to guild 123 within that same 30-second window.


  ### Impact on Applications

  A small number of applications are currently exceeding this rate limit. If your app heavily relies on this opcode, we recommend reviewing your current implementation and making necessary adjustments to maintain functionality.

  ### Timeline

  Most apps won’t encounter this rate limit until it is rolled out to all servers on **October 1, 2025**. However, if you are the developer of an app that is requesting all guild members in very large guilds then you may start seeing this **as soon as today**, so we can ensure platform stability.

  ### What you need to do

  If your application uses [Request Guild Members](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#request-guild-members) to request all members, we recommend:

  - Implement caching mechanisms for member data
  - Update your cache using the `GUILD_MEMBER_ADD`, `GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE`, and `GUILD_MEMBER_REMOVE` gateway events

  If you hit this limit, you will receive the [`RATE_LIMITED`](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#rate-limited) event as a response.
</Update>

<Update label="Discord Social SDK Communication Features - General Availability" description="2025-08-13" tags={["Discord Social SDK"]}>
  ### Discord Social SDK Communication Features - General Availability

  Communication features (cross-platform messaging, voice chat, lobbies, and linked channels) are now generally available for all Discord
  Social SDK users that meet our application process criteria. Previously available only in closed beta, these features 
  enable seamless player interaction within your game.

  * **Direct Messages**: One-on-one private chat functionality
  * **Discord voice chat**: Real-time voice communication inside game lobbies
  * **Lobbies & In-Game text chat**: Virtual spaces where players can interact through voice and text chat
  * **Linked Channels**: Integration with Discord's server-based text channels directly in your game UI

  ### New Application Process for Full Access

  We've launched an application process for developers who want to remove rate limits and gain production level access to communication features. Developers can now apply through our developer portal with detailed game information and usage projections to unlock production-level capacity.

  As part of documenting this application process, we have also documented pre-approval rate limits, so you can build, test and develop against the Social SDK with confidence.

  ### Get Started with the Social SDK

  The Discord Social SDK binaries are available for download in the Developer Portal after enabling the Discord Social SDK for your application.

</Update>

<Update label="Embedded App SDK Version 2.1 & 2.2" description="2025-08-11"  tags={["Activities", "Embedded App SDK"]}>
  We've made a few improvements to the Embedded App SDK for version 2.2.0, here are the highlights:

  ### Changes in version 2.1

  #### New URL fields

  We now support new fields for rich presence activities:

  - `state_url` - URL that is linked to when clicking on the state text in the activity card
  - `details_url` - URL that is linked to when clicking on the details text in the activity card
  - `assets.large_url` - URL that is linked to when clicking on the large image in the activity card
  - `assets.small_url` - URL that is linked to when clicking on the small image in the activity card

  ### Changes in version 2.2

  #### patchUrlMappings

  In line with the [recent change](/developers/docs/change-log#remove-proxy-from-discord-activity-proxy-path) to remove the `.proxy/` path from Discord Activity proxy URLs, the `patchUrlMappings` utility has been updated to generate simplified URLs by default. It will now create mappings without the `.proxy/` prefix.

  The Embedded App SDK is available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discord/embedded-app-sdk) and [GitHub](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk). You can check out our [installation guide and reference](/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk) to get started with it!
</Update>

<Update label="Remove .proxy/ from Discord Activity proxy path" description="July 30, 2025" tags={["Activities", "Embedded App SDK"]}>
  We've updated the Content Security Policy (CSP) for Discord Activities to remove the `.proxy/` path requirement when making requests through the discordsays.com proxy. This change simplifies the developer experience while maintaining full backwards compatibility. This was made possible by resolving the underlying privacy considerations that originally required the `.proxy/` path restriction.

  #### Before

  Activities were required to make proxy requests through paths prefixed with `/.proxy/`:

  ```
  https://<application_id>.discordsays.com/.proxy/api/endpoint
  ```

  #### After

  Activities can now make proxy requests directly without the `/.proxy/` prefix:

  ```
  https://<application_id>.discordsays.com/api/endpoint
  ```

  #### Technical Details

  - **CSP Update**: The Content Security Policy now allows requests to `https://<app_id>.discordsays.com/*` instead of the more restrictive `https://<app_id>.discordsays.com/.proxy/*`
  - **Proxy Behavior**: Both URL patterns work identically - your existing proxy mappings (e.g., `/api -> example.com`) will function the same way regardless of whether you use `/.proxy/api` or `/api`
  - **Performance**: No performance differences between the two approaches

  #### Developer Tooling Updates

  The `patchUrlMappings` utility will be updated in an upcoming Embedded App SDK release to generate the simplified URLs by default, though it will continue to support the `.proxy/` format for backward compatibility.

  #### Backward Compatibility

  **All existing code will continue to work without changes.** The `/.proxy/` path prefix is still fully supported and will be maintained indefinitely. You can:

  - Continue using existing `/.proxy/` URLs
  - Switch to the new, simplified URLs
  - Use both patterns simultaneously in the same application

  **No migration is required.** This is a purely additive change that expands what's possible rather than breaking existing functionality.
</Update>

<Update label="Guild Create Deprecation" description="July 28, 2025" tags={["HTTP API"]}>
  Apps can no longer create guilds. The documentation for these endpoints has been removed and the endpoints have been removed from the OpenAPI specification.

  See our [earlier changelog entry](/developers/docs/change-log#deprecating-guild-creation-by-apps) for more information.
</Update>

<Update label="Clickable Links and Customizable Statuses in Rich Presence" description="July 17, 2025" tags={["Activities", "Embedded App SDK"]}>
  We've added new functionality to Rich Presences to give users of your application a more interactive and flexible experience. There are two big changes as part of this:
  - You can now add clickable links to the state text, details text, large image & small image
  - You can now choose which field (name, state, or details) is used in users' status text in the member list (e.g. instead of "Listening to MyMusic" you can now have your status text show "Listening to Rick Astley")

  All of these new fields are documented on the [Activity Object](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#activity-object) section of Gateway Events and also available through the Embedded App SDK.
</Update>


<Update label="Gradient Roles and Guild Tags" description="July 02, 2025" tags={["HTTP API"]}>
  We've documented gradient role colors and guild tags in the API. Guild tags let users rep their favorite server with a 1-4 character badge next to their display name. They can be accessed using the `primary_guild` field on the user object. Servers can now give gradient colors to their roles instead of a single, solid color. Gradient colors use the new `colors` field on the role object. As part of this change, the `color` field on roles is now deprecated, but it will still work for backwards compatibility.

  #### Gradient Role Colors

  - The guild feature `ENHANCED_ROLE_COLORS` will let you know if a guild is able to set gradient colors to roles. 
  - Guild roles now have `colors` as part of the [structure](/developers/docs/topics/permissions#role-object-role-structure).
  - `color` on guild roles is deprecated but will still be returned by the API and continues to work for backwards compatibility.
  - [Role color structure](/developers/docs/topics/permissions#role-object-role-colors-object)

  #### Guild Tags

  - Guild tags can be retrieved through the `primary_guild` field on the user object.
  - [User Primary Guild](/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object-user-primary-guild)
</Update>

<Update label="Discord Social SDK Release 1.4" description="June 26, 2025" tags={["Discord Social SDK"]}>
  A new release of the Discord Social SDK is now available, with the following updates:

  ### Lobby Chat History

  - Added [`Client::GetLobbyMessagesWithLimit`] to retrieve lobby message histories based on a provided lobby ID, with a
    maximum of 200 messages and up to 72 hours.
  - Only messages from lobbies the user is currently a member of can be retrieved.
  - DM history will be coming soon too!

  ### Unified Friends List

  - Added [`Client::GetRelationshipsByGroup`] which both logically groups a user’s relationships for the purpose of
    rendering a friends list and sorts users based on
    our [Unified Friends List design guidelines](/developers/docs/discord-social-sdk/design-guidelines/unified-friends-list).
    Before, it was necessary to call [`Client::GetRelationships`] and manually partition each relationship into the
    appropriate friend group, as well as write your own sorting operations.
  - Added [`Client::SetRelationshipGroupsUpdatedCallback`] which fires whenever a user change occurs which could invalidate
    a previously sorted friends list retrieved from [`Client::GetRelationshipsByGroup`]. Call
    [`Client::GetRelationshipsByGroup`] again to maintain an up-to-date friends list.
  - Added `IsSpamRequest` to [`RelationshipHandle`], returns `true` if Discord believes the request to be spam.

  ### Audio Changes

  - A new experimental audio mode has been added for mobile devices which uses standard media audio streams instead of
    voice-specific processing. On iOS this causes the voice engine to use the Remote I/O Audio Unit instead of Voice
    Processing I/O and likewise on Android, media stream types are used instead of voice communication types. This mode
    may be enabled by creating a Client with a [`ClientCreateOptions`] parameter whose `experimentalAudioSystem` 
    property is
    set to `AudioSystem::Game`. In this case, you should also set [`Client::SetEngineManagedAudioSession`] to true. **We do
    not recommend using this for production** - however, if you are interested in trying it out, we are looking for
    feedback!
  - Added [`Client::SetAecDump`] to enable recording of audio diagnostic information.

  ### Auth

  - Publisher Auth
      - Publisher Auth is a new feature which makes authorization easier for publishers with multiple games. This is an
        early release of this feature and only available to a limited number of partners for now.
      - Added [`Client::ExchangeChildToken`] to facilitate child token exchange for public clients. Confidential clients
        will require a server to server implementation, but this method may be useful for development.
      - Invites from sibling applications will be visible to the SDK. They can be identified by the `applicationId` field
        on the [`ActivityInvite`] payload.
      - Messages sent from other sibling applications will be visible to the SDK. They can be identified by the
        `ApplicationId` method on the [`MessageHandle`].
  - Added [`Client::RevokeToken`] and [`Client::UnmergeIntoProvisionalAccount`] to allow games leveraging Public Clients to
    perform token revocation or unmerge operations directly from clients.

  ### Android

  - The SDK is now compatible with 16KB page size.

  ### Misc

  - Improved activity serialization, avoiding including null/empty keys in the JSON payload.
</Update>

<Update label="Paginated Pin Endpoints" description="June 25, 2025" tags={["HTTP API"]}>
  We've added new endpoints to manage paginated pins in channels. The Get Channel Pins endpoint allows you to retrieve and manage pinned messages in a more efficient way, especially for channels with a large number of pinned messages. Both Pin and Unpin endpoints remain the same with a new route. As part of this change we have deprecated the old endpoints for pinned messages. Switching to the new endpoints should be straightforward, as they maintain similar functionality but with improved pagination support. 

  #### New Endpoints

  **[Get Channel Pins](/developers/docs/resources/message#get-channel-pins)**: Retrieve a list of pinned messages in a channel with pagination support:  
  <Route method="GET">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/developers/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)/messages/pins</Route>

  **[Pin Message](/developers/docs/resources/message#pin-message)**: Pin a message in a channel:

<Update label="Discord Social SDK Release 1.3" description="June 05, 2025" tags={["Discord Social SDK"]}>
  A new release of the Discord Social SDK is now available, with the following updates:

  ### Authentication
  - Added an `APPLICATION_DEAUTHORIZED` webhook event which can be configured in the developer portal. When a user unlinks their account or revokes authorization for your application in any way, this event will be sent to configured webhooks. The payload will contain serialized user information. See [Webhook Events](/developers/docs/events/webhook-events) docs for more information on configuring webhook events.

  ### PC
  - Added configurable request timeout SDK HTTP client requests. Support is on PC in this release with console and mobile support coming in future release. Timeout default value is 30000ms (30 seconds) and can be configured using the new Client API: [`Client::SetHttpRequestTimeout`]
  - Fixed a crash that can occur when handling certain failed HTTP requests

  ### Mobile
  - [`Client::SetSpeakerMode`] is now deprecated. Unless [`Client::SetEngineManagedAudioSession`] is used, audio routing will be handled automatically by the SDK

  #### Android
  - Fixed routing of game and voice audio when external audio devices are connected and/or disconnected. [`Client::SetEngineManagedAudioSession`] has been added to communicate that the SDK should not manage audio routing and automatically enter and leave `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` when joining and leaving calls.
  - Fixed an issue with the Authorize method when a device configuration change needs to restart the activity

  #### iOS
  - Various fixes for audio routing and session management. When using the Unity plugin, game audio will no longer stop playing when ending a call. For standalone SDK use, a method [`Client::SetEngineManagedAudioSession`] has been added to communicate that the SDK should not automatically start and stop the `AVAudioSession` when joining and leaving calls.
  - Corrected supported platform values in `Info.plist` for iOS .frameworks.

  ### Consoles
  - Standalone archives now only contain console-specific files, like the Unity and Unreal Engine archives

  ### Misc
  - Fixed a thread safety issue with [`Client::AddLogCallback`]
  - Added [Flags] declaration for bit flags enums in C#
</Update>


<Update label="Discord Social SDK Release 1.2" description="May 05, 2025" tags={["Discord Social SDK"]}>
  A new release of the Discord Social SDK is now available, with the following updates:

  ### Rich Presence
  - Added support for adding custom buttons on activity cards via [`Activity::AddButton`]

  ### Packaging
  - Unity and Unreal plugin artifacts now contain just the additional files for console support so they can be extracted on top of the base plugin
  - Unity plugin is now packaged as a .zip that you should extract inside the Packages directory of your project to enable the above
  - Console archives now contain a small README with some console-specific documentation

  ### Misc
  - Added [`Client::OpenConnectedGamesSettingsInDiscord`] for deeplinking into Discord's settings for connected games, which provides players some control over who can DM them
  - Fixed a hang that could occur on Linux in [`Client::RegisterLaunchCommand`] and [`Client::RegisterLaunchSteamApplication`]
  - [`Client::RegisterLaunchCommand`] and [`Client::RegisterLaunchSteamApplication`] now work from inside the Steam Runtime on Linux
  - Fixed a crash on exit that could occur when there were pending callbacks in the queue
</Update>

<Update label="Raised Component Limits" description="April 29, 2025" tags={["User Apps", "HTTP API", "Interactions"]}>
  We're removing the top level component limit and raising the limit on number of components in a message to 40 when using the [`IS_COMPONENTS_V2` message flag](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-object-message-flags)! We're also removing the limit on the number of components in a [Container Component](/developers/docs/components/reference#container). Legacy messages have not changed and continue to allow up to 5 action rows.

  #### What's New

  - **Total components**: The limit for total components in a message has been increased to 40.
  - **Top-level components**: There is no longer a limit on top level components in a message (previously it was 10).
  - **[Container Component](/developers/docs/components/reference#container)**: There is no longer a limit on the number of components in a Container Component (previously it was 10).

  #### Developer Resources

  - Check out our [Component Reference](/developers/docs/components/reference) for detailed specifications on all available components.
  - Learn how to build rich message layouts with components with [Using Message Components](/developers/docs/components/using-message-components).
</Update>

<Update label="Introducing New Components for Messages!" description="April 22, 2025" tags={["User Apps", "HTTP API", "Interactions"]}>
  We're bringing new components to messages that you can use in your apps. They allow you to have full control over the layout of your messages.

  #### Why We Built Components V2

  Our previous components system, while functional, had limitations:

  - Content, attachments, embeds, and components had to follow fixed vertical positioning rules
  - Visual styling options were limited
  - It was difficult to make visually cohesive experiences that combined the various functionalities of messages given they were expressed in a non-unified system

  Our new component system addresses these challenges with fully composable components that can be arranged and laid out in any order, allowing for a more flexible and visually appealing design.

  #### What's New

  [Components V2](/developers/docs/components/overview) introduces several new component types that can be used in messages:

  #### New Layout Components

  - [**Section**](/developers/docs/components/reference#section) - Combine text with an accessory component for contextually linked elements
  - [**Container**](/developers/docs/components/reference#container) - Create visually distinct groupings with a customizable accent color
  - [**Separator**](/developers/docs/components/reference#separator) - Add visual spacing and dividers between components

  #### New Content Components

  - [**Text Display**](/developers/docs/components/reference#text-display) - Add rich markdown-formatted text anywhere in your messages
  - [**Thumbnail**](/developers/docs/components/reference#thumbnail) - An image used in a [section](/developers/docs/components/reference#section)
  - [**Media Gallery**](/developers/docs/components/reference#media-gallery) - Present collections of images and videos in an organized grid
  - [**File**](/developers/docs/components/reference#file) - Embed file attachments as part of your message layout

  #### Getting Started

  To use the new components, you'll need to send the message flag `1 << 15` (`IS_COMPONENTS_V2`) which activates the components system on a per-message basis. 

  We've created guides to help you implement these new features:

  - [Using Message Components](/developers/docs/components/using-message-components) - Learn how to build rich message layouts with components
  - [Using Modal Components](/developers/docs/components/using-modal-components) - Create interactive forms and dialogs

  #### Compatibility Notes

  [Legacy component behavior](/developers/docs/components/reference#legacy-message-component-behavior) will continue to work as before, so your existing integrations won't break. However, when using the Components V2 flag, you'll need to adapt to a few changes:

  - The `content` and `embeds` fields will no longer work but you'll be able to use [Text Display](/developers/docs/components/reference#text-display) and [Container](/developers/docs/components/reference#container) as replacements
  - Attachments need to be exposed through components to be visible. You can use a [Media Gallery](/developers/docs/components/reference#media-gallery), [Thumbnail](/developers/docs/components/reference#thumbnail), or [File](/developers/docs/components/reference#file) component to display them
  - The `poll` and `stickers` fields are disabled
  - A max of 10 top-level components and 30 total components in a message

  #### Developer Resources

  Check out our [Component Reference](/developers/docs/components/reference) for detailed specifications on all available components.

  We can't wait to see what you build!

<Update label="Deprecating Guild Creation by Apps" description="April 15, 2025" tags={["HTTP API"]}>
  ### Breaking Change

  To address security concerns, we are deprecating the ability for applications to create guilds using the `Create Guild`
  endpoint.

  #### What's Changing

  - The Create Guild endpoint (`POST /guilds`) will be restricted for applications starting July 15, 2025
  - Existing Guilds owned by bots will have their ownership transferred to a real user
  - After the deprecation date, the endpoint will no longer be available

  #### Timeline

  - **April 15, 2025**: Deprecation announcement
  - **June 15, 2025**: System DM/Email notifications sent to affected app owners and designated guild members
  - **July 15, 2025**: `Create Guild` endpoint will no longer be available

  If your app is affected, you will receive a migration plan via Discord System DM.

  We understand this change may affect some legitimate use cases. If you have questions or believe your application
  requires continued access to guild creation functionality, please contact us through
  the [Developer Support portal](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc).

<Update label="Custom Incentivized Links" description="April 11, 2025" tags={["Activities", "Embedded App SDK"]}>
  ### Custom Incentivized Links for Activities

  Custom Incentivized Links are used to customize how your incentivized link embed appears to users. You can create them in the developer portal or generate them from within your activity. Incentivized Links can be used as referral links, promotions, deep-linking into your activity, and more.

  - shareLink will now let you attach custom params to links you share about your game using `custom_id`.
  - Removed `referrer_id` from shareLink API. Any uses of `referrer_id` should be moved over to use `custom_id` instead. Passing `referrer_id` to shareLink will silently fail.

  Learn more about [creating and managing Custom Incentivized Links](/developers/docs/activities/development-guides/growth-and-referrals#creating-and-managing-custom-incentivized-links) and [how to generate them from within your activity](/developers/docs/activities/development-guides/growth-and-referrals#generating-a-custom-link-within-your-activity) with the shareLink API.

  The Embedded App SDK is available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discord/embedded-app-sdk) and [GitHub](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk). You can check out our [installation guide and reference](/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk) to get started with it!
</Update>

<Update label="Per-Attachment File Upload Behavior for Apps" description="April 03, 2025" tags={["HTTP API", "Interactions"]}>
  Starting today, file upload limits for apps are checked per-attachment rather than per-message. This change makes the app attachment behavior the same as when a user uploads multiple attachments on a single message.

  - File size limits now apply to each individual attachment
  - Previously, limits were applied to the combined size of all attachments in a message
  - This aligns app attachment handling with user attachment behavior

  The interaction payload will also include a new `attachment_size_limit` key that specifies the maximum allowed attachment size. This limit may be higher than the default attachment size limit, depending on the guild's boost status or the invoking user's Nitro status.

  For more information, check out [our documentation on file uploads](/developers/docs/reference#uploading-files).
</Update>

<Update label="Introducing the Discord Social SDK" description="March 17, 2025" tags={["Discord Social SDK"]}>

<Update label="Premium Apps: Multiple Subscription Tiers" description="December 12, 2024" tags={["Premium Apps"]}>
  Developers with monetization enabled can now create and publish multiple subscription SKUs of the same type for their app. This allows developers to offer different subscription tiers with varying benefits and pricing. Users can upgrade and downgrade between published subscription SKUs.

  ### What's Changed

  #### Developer Portal
  - Under the `Monetization` tab, you can now publish multiple subscription SKUs of the same type for your app.

  #### App's Store Page
  - When multiple subscription SKUs are published: Users can now upgrade or downgrade between different published subscription SKUs.

  #### User App Subscription Settings
  - When multiple subscription SKUs are published: Users can now upgrade or downgrade between different published subscription SKUs.
  - These settings are available under `User Settings → Subscriptions → App Subscriptions`.

  #### Subscription Object
  - New field `renewal_sku_ids` added to the [subscription object](/developers/docs/resources/subscription#subscription-object) response for `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE` events and API endpoints. 
  - `renewal_sku_ids` is a list of snowflakes that indicate the SKU(s) that the user will be subscribed to at renewal.

  #### Updated Guide: Managing SKUs
  - The [Managing SKUs](/developers/docs/monetization/managing-skus#creating-a-sku) guide has been updated to include information about creating and managing multiple subscription SKUs.

  #### Updated Guide: Implementing App Subscriptions
  - The [Implementing App Subscriptions](/developers/docs/monetization/implementing-app-subscriptions#supporting-upgrades-and-downgrades) guide has been updated to include information about supporting upgrades and downgrades between multiple subscription SKUs.

<Update label="Entitlement Migration Completed" description="November 05, 2024" tags={["Premium Apps"]}>
  The [entitlement migration](/developers/docs/change-log#premium-apps-entitlement-migration-and-new-subscription-api) which began on **October 1, 2024**, has been successfully completed as of **November 1, 2024**.

  ### What's Changed

  - The documentation has been updated to reflect the new entitlement system as the standard behavior.
  - `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event for subscription-related entitlements now only occur when the subscription ends.
  - The `ends_at` value on the [entitlement object](/developers/docs/resources/entitlement#entitlement-object) is now set when the subscription ends.
  - To determine when a subscription was canceled, listen for `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE` events or use the [Subscription API](/developers/docs/resources/subscription) to retrieve the subscription's `status` and `canceled_at` timestamp.

  For more details about the migration process, please refer to the [migration guide](/developers/docs/change-log#updates-to-entitlement-migration-guide).
</Update>

<Update label="Webhook Events" description="October 25, 2024" tags={["Events", "User Apps"]}>
  You can now subscribe to a limited number of HTTP-based outgoing [webhook events](/developers/docs/events/webhook-events#event-types) after [configuring a webhook events URL](/developers/docs/events/webhook-events#configuring-a-webhook-events-url). Currently, 3 events are available: `APPLICATION_AUTHORIZED`, `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE`, and `QUEST_USER_ENROLLMENT`. Read the [webhook events](/developers/docs/events/webhook-events) documentation for details on subscribing and using webhook events.

  <Info>
  When developing [user-installable apps](/developers/docs/resources/application#user-context), [Application Authorized](/developers/docs/events/webhook-events#application-authorized) (which is not available via [the Gateway](/developers/docs/events/gateway)) is useful to receive events when your app was installed to a user or server.
  </Info>

  <Warning>
  `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE` is the only monetization-related event available using webhook events, so you should still use the Gateway for [entitlement-related events](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#entitlements). Other monetization-related events will be supported via webhook events soon.
  </Warning>
</Update>


<Update label="Updates to Entitlement Migration Guide" description="October 07, 2024" tags={["Premium Apps"]}>
  The entitlement migration started on **October 1, 2024** and will continue through 11:59PM PST on **November 1, 2024**.

  We updated our previous entitlement migration guide to provide more up-to-date information on impacts of developer impacts. Here's a summary of the changes we made:

  - The migration will run through November 1, 2024 to ensure that any entitlements that are set to renew in October will be properly migrated to the new entitlement system upon renewal.
  - `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` events will only occur when a subscription ends. 
  - The value of the `ends_at` in `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` events indicate the timestamp for **when the entitlement is no longer valid**.
  - The `ends_at` value on the [entitlement object](/developers/docs/resources/entitlement#entitlement-object) is set when the subscription ends.
  - To receive the value of when a subscription was canceled, you should listen for the `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE` events or use the [Subscription API](/developers/docs/resources/subscription).

<Update label="Activities General Availability" description="September 26, 2024" tags={["Activities", "Embedded App SDK", "Premium Apps"]}>
  Following up on [the rollout of the App Launcher](https://discord.com/blog/discover-more-ways-to-play-with-apps-now-anywhere-on-discord), we’re excited to announce that [Activities](/developers/docs/activities/overview) are now generally available for developers. In addition to API stability, this means that apps with Activities can now be [verified](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/23926564536471-How-Do-I-Get-My-App-Verified), [discoverable](/developers/docs/discovery/enabling-discovery) in the App Directory, and [implement monetization](/developers/docs/monetization/overview).

  ### Recent API Updates

  Since the developer preview was announced, there have been a few important API updates:

  - Activities can now enable and implement monetization features, and [`getEntitlements`](/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk#getentitlements),[`getSkus`](/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk#getskus), and [`startPurchase`](/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk#startpurchase) are generally available in the Embedded App SDK.
  - New [Get Application Activity Instance](/developers/docs/resources/application#get-application-activity-instance) endpoint to make [managing Activity instances](/developers/docs/activities/development-guides/multiplayer-experience#activity-instance-management) easier.
  - Apps with Activities can create an [Entry Point command (type `4`)](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#entry-point-commands), which are the primary entry point for Activities in the App Launcher. When new apps enable Activities, a [default Entry Point command](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#default-entry-point-command) will be created for the app. Read the [original change log](/developers/docs/change-log#entry-point-commands) and the [Entry Point command guide](/developers/docs/activities/development-guides/user-actions#setting-up-an-entry-point-command) for details.
  - Activities can now be launched in response to interactions using the `LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` (type `12`) [interaction callback type](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-type) for `APPLICATION_COMMAND`, `MESSAGE_COMPONENT`, and `MODAL_SUBMIT` [interaction types](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-type).
  - Apps can now be installed to users (in addition to servers). After [setting up your installation contexts](/developers/docs/resources/application#setting-supported-installation-contexts), make sure to request the `application.commands` scope when authorizing with users to make sure your Activity is available for them across their Discord servers, DMs, and Group DMs.
  - In August, there were updates to the Content Security Policy (CSP) for Activities that limits how you can make requests to external resources when building Activities. Read [the change log](/developers/docs/change-log#activities-proxy-csp-update) and the guide on [using external resources](/developers/docs/activities/development-guides/networking#using-external-resources) for details.

  ### Documentation Updates

  We’ve also added and improved the documentation for Activities and the Embedded App SDK to make it easier to build:

  - New reference documentation for [Monetization](/developers/docs/monetization/overview) SDK commands: [`getEntitlements`](/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk#getentitlements),[`getSkus`](/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk#getskus), and [`startPurchase`](/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk#startpurchase)
  - Updated [Embedded App SDK Reference](/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk) documentation that adds signatures and arguments
  - Updated development guides for [Activity Instance Management](/developers/docs/activities/development-guides/multiplayer-experience#activity-instance-management) and [Activity Proxy Considerations](/developers/docs/activities/development-guides/networking#activity-proxy-considerations) when using external resources
  - New guide on implementing [In-App Purchases (IAP) for Activities](/developers/docs/monetization/implementing-iap-for-activities)
  - New guides for [Verification and Discovery Surfaces](/developers/docs/discovery/overview)
  - New guide on [Using Rich Presence with the Embedded App SDK](/developers/docs/rich-presence/using-with-the-embedded-app-sdk)

<Update label="Voice End-to-End Encryption (DAVE Protocol)" description="September 17, 2024" tags={["Voice"]}>
  Introduced [high-level documentation](/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections) for Discord's Audio and Video End-to-End Encryption (DAVE) protocol, and the [new voice gateway opcodes](/developers/docs/topics/opcodes-and-status-codes#voice) required to support it

  ### **Developer Impact**

  Starting September 2024, Discord is migrating voice and video in DMs, Group DMs, voice channels, and Go Live streams to use end-to-end encryption (E2EE). 

  **Who this affects:** Any libraries or apps that support [Voice Connections](/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections).

  You are not immediately required to support the E2EE protocol, as calls will automatically upgrade/downgrade to/from E2EE depending on the support of clients in the call.

  ### **Implementing E2EE Voice**

  We have added high-level documentation for Discord's Audio and Video End-to-End Encryption (DAVE) protocol, and the new voice gateway opcodes required to support it.

  The most thorough documentation on the DAVE protocol is found in the [Protocol Whitepaper](https://daveprotocol.com/). You can also use our open-source library [libdave](https://github.com/discord/libdave) to assist with your implementation. The exact format of the DAVE protocol opcodes is detailed in the [Voice Gateway Opcodes section of the protocol whitepaper](https://daveprotocol.com/#voice-gateway-opcodes).

  ### **Future Deprecation and Discontinuation of Non-E2EE Voice**

  Non-E2EE connections to voice in DMs, Group DMs, voice channels, and Go Live streams will eventually be deprecated and discontinued.

  In 2025, all official Discord clients will support the protocol and it will be an enforced requirement to connect to the end-to-end encryption-eligible audio/video session types listed above.

  Once a timeline for deprecation and discontinuation is finalized, we will share details and developers will have **at least six months** to implement before we sunset non-E2EE voice connections.

<Update label="Premium Apps: Entitlement Migration and New Subscription API" description="August 28, 2024" tags={["Premium Apps", "Breaking Changes"]}>
  <Info>
  Updates to this Change Log entry was published on **October 7, 2024** to reflect up-to-date information. See the [new Change Log entry](/developers/docs/change-log#updates-to-entitlement-migration-guide) for details on updates.
  </Info>

  We are migrating our entitlement system to a new behavior where entitlements will not end until explicitly canceled, representing a breaking change for subscription management. We are introducing a [Subscription API](/developers/docs/resources/subscription) and [Subscription Events](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#subscriptions) to allow handling subscription-related events.

  <Warning>
  This change will be rolled out to all existing applications that have entitlements for user and guild subscription SKUs, starting on October 1, 2024.
  </Warning>

  - `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE` events will now be triggered with a null `ends_at` value for all ongoing subscriptions, indicating an indefinite entitlement.
  - `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` events will occur only when a subscription ends, with the `ends_at` value indicating the end date.
  - Discord-managed Subscription entitlements will have an `type` value of `PURCHASE` (type `1`) instead of `APPLICATION_SUBSCRIPTION` (type `8`).

  ### Migration Plan & Guide:

  As of **October 1, 2024**, all existing entitlements that grant access to user-subscription and guild-subscription SKUs will automatically transfer to the new system on their renewal date. This means we will have a month-long migration window to allow all of your entitlements to migrate to the new system upon renewal.

  Developers are advised to update their systems to handle the new `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE` and `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` events according to the following migration guide before the rollout date to avoid service disruptions.

  ### Introducing a New Subscription API

  With the new entitlement behavior, entitlements for subscription SKUs will no longer emit events at the start of a new subscription billing period. Instead, subscription lifecycle management can be handled through the new [Subscription API](/developers/docs/monetization/implementing-app-subscriptions#using-the-subscription-api).
  Developers should refer to the [Subscription resource](/developers/docs/resources/subscription) for information on calling the Subscription API and responding to Subscription events. For in-depth implementation details, see our [Implementing App Subscriptions](/developers/docs/monetization/implementing-app-subscriptions#using-the-subscription-api) guide. You can start using this API now.

  ### Monetization Documentation Updates

  As part of these changes, we've updated the documentation for Premium Apps.

  - Created a new [Enabling Monetization](/developers/docs/monetization/enabling-monetization) page to cover setting up your team, managing payouts, and enabling monetization for your apps
  - Created a new [Managing SKUs](/developers/docs/monetization/managing-skus#creating-a-sku) page to document how to create, update, publish, and promote your SKUs
  - Moved and added [Entitlement](/developers/docs/resources/entitlement), [SKU](/developers/docs/resources/sku) and [Subscription](/developers/docs/resources/subscription) resources to the **Resources** section
  - Updated guides for [Implementing App Subscriptions](/developers/docs/monetization/implementing-app-subscriptions) and [Implementing One-Time Purchases](/developers/docs/monetization/implementing-one-time-purchases)

  ### Subscription Entitlement Migration Guide

  Starting on **October 1, 2024**, we will be migrating our existing entitlement system to a new behavior where **entitlements do not expire until explicitly canceled**. This migration guide outlines the changes and impacts of this migration on developers and guides how to manage these changes effectively.

  <Warning>
  With this update, entitlements for subscription SKUs will no longer emit events when a new subscription billing period begins. If you need to know when a subscription has been renewed, use the new [Subscription API](/developers/docs/resources/subscription) and related [Subscription Gateway Events](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#subscriptions).
  </Warning>

  ### Current System

  Currently, entitlements for Subscription SKUs purchased through Discord have:

  - An `ends_at` date that corresponds to the subscription interval. This date is updated at each billing cycle.
  - A entitlement `type` value of `APPLICATION_SUBSCRIPTION` (type `8`).
  - An `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event is triggered at the start of each new subscription period.

  ### New System

  Post-migration, entitlements for Subscription SKUs purchased through Discord will:

  - No longer have an end date (`ends_at` will be `null`) until the user decides to cancel the subscription.
  - Now have an entitlement `type` value of `PURCHASE` (type `1`).
  - No `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` events will be triggered until the subscription is canceled.

  ### Migration Timeline

  - **Migration Start Date:** October 1, 2024
  - **Migration End Date:** November 1, 2024

  ### Migration Impacts

  ### 1) Existing Entitlements Scheduled to Renew

  - **During Migration Window:**
      - These will automatically transfer to the new system.
      - A new `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE` event will be triggered to indicate the migration. This does not indicate a net new entitlement.
      - No further events will be generated until the entitlement ends, which will then trigger an `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event.
      - The `ends_at` value in the `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event and in the Entitlement API will indicate the timestamp when the entitlement ends.

  ### 2) Existing Entitlements Set to End

  - **During Migration Window:**
      - These entitlements will naturally expire and not renew under the new system.
      - No new entitlement events will be generated for these cases.

  ### Developer Actions

  - **Pre-Migration:**
      - Review and understand the new entitlement event structure.
      - Adjust your system to handle `ends_at` being null, which now indicates an indefinite entitlement.
      - Adjust your system not to expect type `APPLICATION_SUBSCRIPTION` (type `8`) for Discord-managed subscription entitlements.
  - **Post-Migration:**
      - Monitor for `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE`, `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE`, `SUBSCRIPTION_CREATE`, and `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE` events.
      - Update any references to an entitlement `ends_at` timestamps, which now indicate the ending of an entitlement. If you need to know when a subscription's period ends, use the [Subscription API](/developers/docs/resources/subscription) and related [Subscription Gateway Events](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#subscriptions).

<Update label="Launching Activities in Response to Interactions" description="August 26, 2024" tags={["Activities", "Interactions"]}>
  [Activities](/developers/docs/activities/overview) can now be launched as a response to interactions using the `LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` (type `12`) [interaction callback type](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-type). `LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` can be used in response to `APPLICATION_COMMAND`, `MESSAGE_COMPONENT`, and `MODAL_SUBMIT` [interaction types](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-type).
</Update>

<Update label="Entry Point Commands" description="August 26, 2024" tags={["Activities", "Interactions"]}>
  Apps with [Activities](/developers/docs/activities/overview) enabled can now create [Entry Point commands](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#entry-point-commands) using the `PRIMARY_ENTRY_POINT` (type `4`) [command type](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-types). Apps are limited to one globally-scoped Entry Point command, which appears in the App Launcher.

  When creating or updating an Entry Point command, an [Entry Point handler](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-entry-point-command-handler-types) can be defined using the [`handler` field](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-structure). The `handler` field determines whether your app wants to manually handle responding to the interaction:
  - If the value is `DISCORD_LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` (`2`), Discord will automatically handle the interaction and send a follow-up message to the channel where the Entry Point command was invoked from.
  - If the value is `APP_HANDLER` (`1`), your app will receive an interaction token and will be responsible for responding to the interaction. In this case, you can launch your Activity using the `LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` (type `12`) [interaction callback](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-type).

  More details about Entry Point commands can be found in the [Application Commands documentation](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#entry-point-commands) and in the [Activity development guide](/developers/docs/activities/development-guides/user-actions#setting-up-an-entry-point-command).

  ### Default Entry Point Commands

  Starting today, when you enable Activities in your [app's settings](http://discord.com/developers/applications), a [default Entry Point command](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#default-entry-point-command) called "Launch" will automatically be created for your app. This can be customized or deleted like other commands if you want to update the name or handler type.

<Update label="Voice Gateway Version 8 and Deprecation of Versions < 4" description="August 13, 2024" tags={["Gateway", "Voice"]}>
  We are officially deprecating some very old voice gateway versions (> 7 years ago).

  * The voice gateway now supports a resume which re-sends lost messages. Use voice gateway version 8 and refer to [Buffered Resume](/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections#buffered-resume).
  * We have removed the default option for voice gateway version. Once this is deprecated, you must pass a voice gateway version.

  <Danger>
  You will be required to pass a voice gateway version and deprecated voice gateway versions will be discontinued as of November 18th, 2024. See [Voice Gateway Versioning](/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections#voice-gateway-versioning) for further details.
  </Danger>

<Update label="Get Guild Role Endpoint" description="August 12, 2024" tags={["HTTP API"]}>
  Need to get just one role, not the whole role list? Use the new [Get Guild Role](/developers/docs/resources/guild#get-guild-role) endpoint to fetch a single role by ID.
</Update>

<Update label="User App Install Count" description="August 09, 2024" tags={["User Apps"]}>
  We've added an approximate user install count to the [Application object](/developers/docs/resources/application#application-object) for user-installable apps. You can also view an app's install counts in the developer portal.
</Update>

<Update label="Voice State Endpoints" description="August 05, 2024" tags={["Voice", "HTTP API"]}>
  Voice states can now be accessed over the HTTP API! Apps can use the new [Get Current User Voice State](/developers/docs/resources/voice#get-current-user-voice-state) and [Get User Voice State](/developers/docs/resources/voice#get-user-voice-state) endpoints to fetch a user's voice state without a Gateway connection.
</Update>

<Update label="Supported Activity Types for SET_ACTIVITY" description="July 25, 2024">
  The [`SET_ACTIVITY` RPC command](/developers/docs/topics/rpc#setactivity) has been updated to support 3 additional [activity types](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#activity-object-activity-types): Listening (`2`), Watching (`3`), and Competing (`5`). Previously, it only accepted Playing (`0`).

  <Warning>
  The [Game SDK](/developers/docs/developer-tools/game-sdk#activities) has not been updated to support setting [`ActivityType`](/developers/docs/developer-tools/game-sdk#activitytype-enum), and is still limited to read-only (to handle events that you receive from Discord).
  </Warning>
</Update>

<Update label="Application Emoji" description="July 18, 2024">
  You can now upload emojis for your application in your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and use them as custom emojis anywhere on Discord.

  * Up to 2000 emojis per app
  * Support for user-installable apps
  * Can be [managed via the API](/developers/docs/resources/emoji#create-application-emoji) with a bot token
</Update>

<Update label="Activities Proxy CSP Update" description="July 17, 2024" tags={["Activities", "Embedded App SDK", "Breaking Changes"]}>
  <Warning>
  This change is outdated. We have since updated the Activities Proxy CSP and the use of `/.proxy/` is no longer required. For the latest information, please refer to [this changelog](/developers/docs/change-log#remove-proxy-from-discord-activity-proxy-path).
  </Warning>

  This change will be rolled out to all existing applications on **August 28, 2024**.

  We will be updating our Content Security Policy (CSP) for the Activities Domain (`https://<application_id>.discordsays.com`). This represents a **breaking change** for **all Activities**, and as such we have a migration plan in order.

  our CSP will be updated as follows:

  * all requests must be made through `https://<application_id>.discordsays.com/.proxy/`, and requests to other paths on the `discordsays.com` domain will be blocked.
  * requests to `https://discord.com/api/` will be permitted, but other paths on the `discord.com` domain will be blocked.
  * Only allowed paths on `cdn.discordapp.com` and `media.discordapp.net` will be permitted such as `/attachments/`, `/icons/`, and `/avatars/`.
  * nested child iframes must also mount paths prepended by `/.proxy/`

  As of [embedded-app-sdk v1.4.0](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/releases/tag/v1.4.0) we have updated `patchUrlMappings` to automatically route requests through `/.proxy/`, so updating your SDK version calling `patchUrlMappings` is a good first step. If you are unfamiliar with `patchUrlMappings`, please consult the [documentation](/developers/docs/activities/development-guides/networking#using-external-resources).

  All Application IDs created after `07/17/2024 12:00:00` UTC (applicationID greater than `1263102905548800000`) will also automatically have the new CSP applied. Testing your production code on a new application created after this date is a suggested way for developers to test compliance with this new CSP.
</Update>

<Update label="Guild Member Banners" description="July 16, 2024">
  Apps can now access guild member profile banners via the API and Gateway! The [guild member object](/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-member-object) now includes a `banner` field which can be used to create the [guild member banner URL](/developers/docs/reference#image-formatting).
</Update>

<Update label="Message Forwarding rollout" description="July 15, 2024">
  We are slowly rolling out the message forwarding feature to users. This feature allows callers to create a message using `message_reference.type = FORWARD` and have the API generate a `message_snapshot` for the sent message. The feature has [some limitations](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-reference-types) and the snapshot is a minimal version of a standard `MessageObject`, but does capture the core parts of a message.

  The resulting message will look something like:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "1255957733279273083",
    "message_reference": {
      "type": 1, // Forward
      ...
    }
    "message_snapshots": [
      {
        "message": {
          "content": "original message",
          "embeds": [...],
          "attachments": [...],
          ...
        }
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
  ```

  We have applied stricter rate limits for this feature based on the following:

  * number of forwards sent by the user
  * total attachment size

  ###### API Updates since preview

  This was [previously announced](https://discord.com/channels/613425648685547541/697138785317814292/1233463756160503859) but note that the final API has a few changes since the API was first previewed:

  * [`message snapshot`](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-snapshot-object) objects don't include a `guild` field anymore since the `message_reference` already provides that information
  * forwarded messages have a distinctive `message_reference` type of `FORWARD` now
</Update>

<Update label="Banners in Get Current User Guilds" description="July 09, 2024">
  [`GET /users/@me/guilds`](/developers/docs/resources/user#get-current-user-guilds) now includes each guild's `banner` field! This enables apps using OAuth2 with the `guilds` scope to display guild banners.
</Update>

<Update label="User-Installed Apps General Availability" description="June 27, 2024" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  Back in March, we announced [the beta for user-installed apps](/developers/docs/change-log#userinstallable-apps-preview). After listening and making updates based on feedback from developers and modmins, we're excited to announce that user-installed apps are now considered generally available and can be used in all servers (regardless of size).

  With this update, there are a few API and behavioral updates for user-installed apps.

  ###### API Updates

  * `user_id` has been removed from the `interaction_metadata` field on messages. Instead, you can use the `id` field in the nested `user` object. See the [Message Interaction Metadata Object](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-interaction-metadata-object) for details.
  * User-installed apps are now limited to creating a maximum of 5 [follow-ups](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#followup-messages) when responding to interactions. This only affects the [Create Followup Message endpoint](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#create-followup-message), and apps installed to the server are unaffected.
  * On [Interactions](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-structure), the value of `authorizing_integration_owners` is now correctly serialized as a string. Previously, the `"0"` value was incorrectly serialized as a number.
  * `app_permissions` on [Interactions](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-structure) now correctly represents the permissions for user-installed apps. Previously, the value was incorrect for user-installed apps.
  * Updating a message can result in a `400` response if the content of the message was blocked by AutoMod, which may be particularly important for [deferred messages](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#responding-to-an-interaction).
  * Interaction responses are no longer forced to be ephemeral for servers with over 25 members.

  ###### New `Use External Apps` Permission

  A new [`USE_EXTERNAL_APPS` (`1 << 50`) permission](/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permissions-bitwise-permission-flags) was added, and is enabled for servers by default. The new permission lets modmins control whether user-installed apps can post public replies in a server. If `Use External Apps` is disabled and your app is *not* installed to the server, your app’s responses will be ephemeral for the end user.

  Read more in the [Moderating Apps on Discord Help Center article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/23957313048343-Moderating-Apps-on-Discord#h_01HZQQQEADYVN2CM4AX4EZGKHM).

  ###### Updated Defaults for New Apps

  * Newly-created apps now default to having both "User Install" *and* "Guild Install" [installation contexts](/developers/docs/resources/application#installation-context) enabled. This can be updated in the **Installation** tab in an [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
  * Newly-created apps now default to using the "Discord Provided Link" [install link](/developers/docs/resources/application#install-links). This can be updated in the **Installation** tab in an [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
  * If Discord Provided Link is selected as the install link type, `application.commands` scope is added to both installation contexts.
</Update>

<Update label="Premium Apps: New Premium Button Style & Deep Linking URL Schemes" description="June 17, 2024">
  **New Premium Button Style**

  Introduces a new `premium` [button style](/developers/docs/components/reference#button-button-styles) to be used with a `sku_id` which points to an active [SKU](/developers/docs/resources/sku#sku-object). This allows developers to customize their premium experience by returning specific subscription or one-time purchase products.

  Learn more about using [button components with interactions](/developers/docs/components/reference#button).

  <Warning>
  This change deprecates Interaction Response Type 10
  </Warning>

  The `PREMIUM_REQUIRED (10)` interaction response type is now deprecated in favor of using custom premium buttons. This will continue to function but may be eventually unsupported. It is recommended to migrate your bots to use the more flexible [premium button component](/developers/docs/components/reference#button-button-styles).

  Learn more about [gating features with premium interactions](/developers/docs/monetization/implementing-app-subscriptions#prompting-users-to-subscribe).

  **Deep Linking URL Schemes for SKUs and Store**

  Introduces two new url schemes for linking directly to the Application Directory. When these links are used in chat, they are rendered as rich embeds that users can interact with to launch an app's store or open a SKU detail modal.

  * New [Store URL Scheme](/developers/docs/monetization/managing-skus#linking-to-your-store): `https://discord.com/application-directory/:appID/store`
  * New [SKU URL Scheme](/developers/docs/monetization/managing-skus#linking-to-a-specific-sku): `https://discord.com/application-directory/:appID/store/:skuID`
</Update>

<Update label="Auto Moderation Member Profile Rule" description="May 31, 2024">
  * Add Auto Moderation `MEMBER_PROFILE` rule [trigger\_type](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-types). This rule type will check if a member's profile contains disallowed keywords.
  * Add Auto Moderation `BLOCK_MEMBER_INTERACTION` [action type](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-action-object-action-types) currently available for the `MEMBER_PROFILE` rule [trigger\_type](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-types). This action will "quarantine" the member to some extent and prevent them from performing most interactions within a specific server.
</Update>

<Update label="Premium Apps: One-Time Purchases and Store" description="April 24, 2024">
  Two new features are now available for Premium Apps: One-Time Purchases and Stores.

  **One-Time Purchases**

  * **Durable Items**: A one-time purchase that is permanent and is not subject to either renewal or consumption, such as lifetime access to an app's premium features.
  * **Consumable Items**: A one-time, non-renewable purchase that provides access, such as a temporary power-up or boost in a game.

  Learn more about [Implementing One-Time Purchases](/developers/docs/monetization/implementing-one-time-purchases).

  **A Store for Your Premium App**

  We have also introduced a Store for your Premium App to showcase your app subscriptions and one-time purchase items. You can now create a unique Store page within the developer portal and add your published subscription SKUs or one-time purchase SKUs to your store view, allowing your users to buy these items from your App Directory or Bot User Profile.

  To explore these features, eligibility details, and how to enable monetization for your app, check out the [Monetization Overview](/developers/docs/monetization/overview).

  **API Documentation Updates**

  The following were added to our public Monetization documentation with this update:

  * New [SKU Object Types](/developers/docs/resources/sku#sku-object-sku-types)
  * New [Entitlement Object Types](/developers/docs/resources/entitlement#entitlement-object-entitlement-types)
  * [Consume an Entitlement](/developers/docs/resources/entitlement#consume-an-entitlement) API endpoint
  * `consumed` field on the [Entitlement](/developers/docs/resources/entitlement) resource
</Update>

<Update label="Modify Guild Member flags field permissions" description="April 23, 2024">
  Update permissions necessary to modify the `flags` field when calling the [Modify Guild Member](/developers/docs/resources/guild#modify-guild-member) endpoint.
</Update>

<Update label="CSV Export for Premium App Analytics" description="April 02, 2024">
  For apps with [Monetization](/developers/docs/monetization/overview) enabled, we have released the ability to export your SKU analytics to CSV. These exports allow you to use your preferred data tools to report on your premium offerings.

  You can find the export at the bottom of the `Monetization → Analytics` tab of your app to export data points such as `sales_count`, `sales_amount`, `sales_currencies`, `cancellation_count`, `refund_amount`, and `refund_count`, aggregated by each of your offerings for the selected month.
</Update>

<Update label="Discord Activities: Developer Preview of the Embedded App SDK" description="March 18, 2024" tags={["Embedded App SDK", "Activities"]}>
  Discord Developers can now build Activities!

  Activities are interactive, multiplayer experiences that run in an iframe in Discord. In order to make the communication between your experience and Discord, we've introduced the Embedded App SDK to assist in communicating between your app and the Discord client.

  * New [Discord Activities](/developers/docs/activities/overview) developer docs with a tutorial, code samples, development guides, and design principles.
  * The Embedded App SDK is now available via [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/@discord/embedded-app-sdk) and [GitHub](http://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk).
  * The [Embedded App SDK Reference](/developers/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk) is now available.

  To learn more about how to get started building your own Activity, check out the [Activities Overview](/developers/docs/activities/overview).
</Update>

<Update label="User-Installable Apps Preview" description="March 18, 2024" tags={["User Apps"]}>
  Apps can now be installed to users—making them easier to install, discover, and access across Discord. User-installed apps can be used across all of a user's servers, within their (G)DMs, and in DMs with the app's bot user.

  When creating or updating your app, you can choose which installation types your app supports on the **Installation** page in your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications). To quickly get started, you can follow the new [Developing a User-Installable App tutorial](/developers/docs/tutorials/developing-a-user-installable-app) or read details about the new changes below.

  This change introduces new concepts and fields across the API that apps will now encounter.

  ###### API Changes

  **Concepts:**

  * [Installation context](/developers/docs/resources/application#installation-context) defines how an app was installed: to a user, a guild (server), or both. Currently, apps will default to only support the guild installation context, but the default may change in the future.
  * Commands can also support one or both installation contexts, with the default being the same as the app's supported installation context(s) at the time of command creation.
  * [Interaction context](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#interaction-contexts) defines where a command can be used in Discord—within guilds, DM with your app's bot user, and/or within group DMs and DMs other than with your app's bot user.
  * The installation flow for apps have been updated so users can select whether they want to install an app to their account or to a server.

  **API Fields:**

  * New `integration_types_config` field for [Applications](/developers/docs/resources/application#application-object) include the default scopes and permissions for app's supported installation contexts
  * New `integration_types` and `contexts` fields for [Commands](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-structure) are the supported [installation](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#installation-context) and [interaction](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#interaction-contexts) contexts (respectively) for the command. Read [command contexts](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#contexts) documentation for details.
  * New `context` field for [Interactions](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-structure) indicates the [interaction context](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#interaction-contexts) where an interaction was triggered from.
  * New `authorizing_integration_owners` field for [Interactions](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-structure) includes a mapping of installation contexts that the interaction was authorized for, to related snowflakes for that context. Read [Authorizing Integration Owners Object](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-authorizing-integration-owners-object) for details.
  * `app_permissions` is now always serialized for interactions to indicate what [permissions](/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permissions-bitwise-permission-flags) your app has access to in the context its' responding. For (G)DMs with other users, it will include the `ATTACH_FILES | EMBED_LINKS | MENTION_EVERYONE`, and for DMs with the app's bot user it will also contain `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS` for the bot’s DM
  * New `interaction_metadata` on [Messages](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-object) that are created as part of an interaction response (either a response or follow-up). See [Message Interaction Metadata Object](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-interaction-metadata-object) for details.
  * `dm_permission` field for [Commands](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-structure) is deprecated. Apps should use `contexts` instead.
  * `interaction` field for [Messages](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-object) is deprecated. Apps should use `interaction_metadata` instead.

  ###### Limitations and Known Issues

  * During the preview, interaction responses for the user installation context will be forced to be ephemeral in servers with over 25  members. Forced ephemerality is enforced at the client-level, so your app does not need to manually pay attention to server size, and will not receive errors via the API.
  * All [follow-up messages](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#followup-messages) are currently forced to be ephemeral in DMs
  * Follow-up messages have a bug where they will not correctly respect user permissions
</Update>

<Update label="Guild Prune Requiring" description="March 15, 2024" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  The [Get Guild Prune Count](/developers/docs/resources/guild#get-guild-prune-count) and [Begin Guild Prune](/developers/docs/resources/guild#begin-guild-prune)
  endpoints now require the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission alongside the existing `KICK_MEMBERS` requirement.
</Update>

<Update label="Enforced Nonces on Create Message Endpoint" description="February 12, 2024">
  The [Create message](/developers/docs/resources/message#create-message) endpoint now supports an `enforce_nonce` parameter. When set to true, the message will be deduped for the same sender within a few minutes. If a message was created with the same nonce, no new message will be created and the previous message will be returned instead. This behavior will become the default for this endpoint in a future API version.
</Update>

<Update label="Limit Number of Fields in Embeds" description="December 19, 2023">
  [Embed objects](/developers/docs/resources/message#embed-object) are now limited more explicitly to 25 [embed fields](/developers/docs/resources/message#embed-object-embed-field-structure). If you pass more than 25 fields within the an embed's `fields` property, an error will be returned.

  Previously, only the first 25 embed fields would be displayed within the embed but no error was returned.
</Update>

<Update label="Clarification on Permission Splits for Expressions and Events" description="December 15, 2023">
  <Info>
  The existing behavior for `MANAGE_GUILD_EXPRESSIONS` and `MANAGE_EVENTS` will **not be changing**. These permissions will continue to allow your bot users to create, update and delete expressions/events. No action will be needed if you plan to continue using these permissions.
  </Info>

  To support added controls for expressions and events, new [permissions](/developers/docs/topics/permissions) were added for users and roles in July 2023:

  * `CREATE_GUILD_EXPRESSIONS`: `1 << 43`
  * `CREATE_EVENTS`: `1 << 44`

  These allow for creating new expressions and events, as well as editing and deleting those created by the current user.

  <Warning>
  These were rolled out in July 2023 to users and roles and have been added to our developer documentation but **are not yet available to app developers**. We will share an update here when these new permissions are available in your apps.
  </Warning>
</Update>

<Update label="Experimenting with End-to-End Encryption for Voice & Video" description="December 01, 2023" tags={["Voice"]}>
  #### What’s Happening?

  As outlined in [a blog post earlier this year](https://discord.com/blog/encryption-for-voice-and-video-on-discord), we are experimenting with end-to-end encryption (e2ee) for voice and video channels.

  End-to-end encryption is designed to only allow the participants in a call to decipher its contents. One of the protocols we’re experimenting with is called Messaging Layer Security, which we believe would allow us to deliver end-to-end encryption at scale. Intermediaries, including platforms like Discord, are unable to access the content of communications encrypted with end-to-end encryption.

  #### How do I prepare for the changes?

  During this testing phase, there is nothing developers need to do to support end-to-end encryption. Voice channels will automatically downgrade to documented, non-e2ee protocols when a bot user joins the channel. This is transparent to the connecting client but may result in a slight delay between establishing a connection and receiving audio.

  #### What is planned for the future?

  We will be continuing our testing and will share updates along with developer documentation and sample code once it is available.

  Once this information is published, we will provide developers with a substantial timeframe to implement end-to-end encryption when interacting with voice and video.

<Update label="Default Value in Auto-populated Select Menus" description="September 22, 2023">
  A new `default_values` field was added for user (`5`), role (`6`), mentionable (`7`), and channel (`8`) [select menu components](/developers/docs/components/reference). `default_values` is a list of [default value objects](/developers/docs/components/reference#user-select-select-default-value-structure), which each include an `id` (the snowflake value for the resource), as well as a corresponding `type` (either `"user"`, `"role"`, or `"channel"`).
</Update>

<Update label="Team Member Roles" description="August 23, 2023">
  You can now select roles other than admin when inviting users or configuring members of a team. There are four [role types](/developers/docs/topics/teams#team-member-roles-team-member-role-types) that a team member can be assigned: owner, admin, developer, or read-only. The team member object now has an additional [`role` field](/developers/docs/topics/teams#data-models-team-member-object), which is a string representing the member's current role.

  Details about team member roles are in the updated [Teams documentation](/developers/docs/topics/teams#team-member-roles).
</Update>

<Update label="Embed Debugger" description="August 10, 2023">
  We've released a new [Embed Debugger tool](https://discord.com/developers/embeds) that shows you how a URL's metadata will be parsed and rendered as a link embed within the Discord client. Use it to preview your site's embed, or debug why your site's link embed isn't working as expected.
</Update>

<Update label="Activity State for Bot Users" description="August 08, 2023">
  The `state` field in [activity objects](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#activity-object) can now be set when [updating presence](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#update-presence) for a bot user. The value of `state` will appear as a custom status for the bot user when an [activity's `type`](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#activity-object-activity-types) is set to `4`, or as additional data under an activity's name for other activity types.
</Update>

<Update label="Public Preview of OpenAPI 3.1 Specification" description="August 02, 2023">
  We're introducing an [OpenAPI 3.1 spec](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-spec) in public preview to make it easier and more reliable to develop with the HTTP API. While our current developer documentation requires manual reviews and updates, the OpenAPI spec is generated from the source code which means it better reflects the nooks, crannies, and nuances of the Discord API.

  <Warning>
  The public preview of the OpenAPI spec is subject to breaking changes without advance notice, and should not be used within production environments. If you see something that looks incorrect or can be improved, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-spec/issues).
  </Warning>

  The public spec can be found in the new [`discord-api-spec` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-spec).
</Update>

<Update label="New GUILD_MEDIA channel type" description="August 01, 2023">
  * Add the [`GUILD_MEDIA` (16) channel type](/developers/docs/resources/channel#channel-object-channel-types). `GUILD_MEDIA` channels only support threads, similar to `GUILD_FORUM` channels.

  Read the [media channel topic](/developers/docs/topics/threads#media-channels) for more information on the relevant APIs and technical details, or the [media channel Help Center Article](https://creator-support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14346342766743) for more about the feature.

  * Add Auto Moderation `mention_raid_protection_enabled` [trigger\_metadata](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-metadata) field for the `MENTION_SPAM` [trigger\_type](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-types). If this field and its parent `MENTION_SPAM` rule are enabled, Auto Moderation provides baseline detection against sudden spikes in mention activity that are normally indicative of mention raids.
  * Add `safety_alerts_channel_id` [guild](/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-object) field and [`RAID_ALERTS_DISABLED` guild feature flag](/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-object-guild-features) which are associated with join raid protection
</Update>

<Update label="Unique usernames on Discord" description="May 03, 2023">
  <Warning>
  Bot users will stay on the legacy username system for now. More details can be found on the [Developer Help Center article](https://dis.gd/app-usernames).
  </Warning>

  Discord’s username system is changing. Discriminators are being removed and new, unique usernames and display names are being introduced. You can read more details about how changes to the username system affects non-bot users in the [general Help Center article](https://dis.gd/usernames). To learn how it impacts bot users specifically, you can read the [Developer Help Center article](https://dis.gd/app-usernames).

  This changelog focuses only on the technical changes to be aware of to update your app's code.

  ### Identifying migrated users

  The new username system will rollout to users over time rather than all at once. The value of a single zero (`"0"`) in the [`discriminator` field](/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object-user-structure) on a user will indicate that the user has been migrated to the new username system. Note that the discriminator for migrated users will *not* be 4-digits like a standard discriminator (it is `"0"`, not `"0000"`). The value of the `username` field will become the migrated user's unique username.

  After migration of all users is complete, the `discriminator` field may be removed.

  #### Example migrated user

  ```json
  {
    "id": "80351110224678912",
    "username": "nelly",
    "discriminator": "0",
    "global_name": "Nelly",
    "avatar": "8342729096ea3675442027381ff50dfe",
    "verified": true,
    "email": "nelly@discord.com",
    "flags": 64,
    "banner": "06c16474723fe537c283b8efa61a30c8",
    "accent_color": 16711680,
    "premium_type": 1,
    "public_flags": 64
  }
  ```

  ### Display names

  As part of the new username system, standard Discord users can define a non-unique display name. This value will be a new `global_name` field with a max length of 32 characters. If the user has not set a display name, `global_name` will be null.

  ### Default avatars

  For users with migrated accounts, default avatar URLs will be based on the user ID instead of the discriminator. The URL can now be calculated using `(user_id >> 22) % 6`. Users on the legacy username system will continue using `discriminator % 5`.
</Update>

<Update label="Bot users added to all new apps" description="April 14, 2023">
  Starting today, [bot users](/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bot-vs-user-accounts) will be added to all newly-created apps. Settings and configuration options for bot users remain the same, and can still be accessed on the **Bot** page within your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

  If your app doesn't need or want a bot user associated with it, you can refrain from adding the [`bot` scope](/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) when installing your app.
</Update>

<Update label="Interaction Channel Data" description="April 06, 2023">
  Interactions now contain a `channel` field which is a partial channel object and guaranteed to contain `id` and `type`. We recommend that you begin using this channel field to identify the source channel of the interaction, and may deprecate the existing `channel_id` field in the future. See the [interaction documentation](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object) for more details.
</Update>

<Update label="Add Auto Moderation custom_message Action Metadata Field" description="February 24, 2023">
  Add new `custom_message` [action metadata](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-action-object-action-metadata) for the `BLOCK_MESSAGE` [action type](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-action-object-action-types)). You can now specify a custom string for every Auto Moderation rule that will be shown to members whenever the rule blocks their message. This can be used as an additional explanation for why a message was blocked and as a chance to help members understand your server's rules and guidelines.
</Update>

<Update label="Update to Locked Threads" description="February 10, 2023">
  ### Upcoming Changes

  Currently, threads in Discord (including forum posts) can either be archived or both locked and archived. Starting on **March 6, 2023**, threads will be able to be locked *without* being archived, which will slightly change the meaning of the [`locked` field](/developers/docs/resources/channel#thread-metadata-object-thread-metadata-structure).

  `locked` currently indicates that a thread cannot be reopened by a user without the [`MANAGE_THREADS` (`1 << 34`) permission](/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permissions-bitwise-permission-flags), but it doesn't restrict user activity within active (meaning non-archived) threads. After this change, users (including bot users) without the `MANAGE_THREADS` permission will be more restricted in locked threads. Users won't be able to create or update messages in locked threads, or update properties like its title or tags. Additionally, some user activity like deleting messages and adding or removing reactions will *only* be allowed in locked threads if that thread is also active (or un-archived).

  If a user or bot user has the `MANAGE_THREADS` permission, they will still be able to make changes to the thread and messages. The upcoming change does not affect the meaning of the [`archived` field](/developers/docs/resources/channel#thread-metadata-object-thread-metadata-structure) or the behavior of a thread that is both locked and archived.

  ### How do I prepare for this change?

  If your app is interacting with threads (including forum posts), it should check the state of the `locked` and/or `archived` field for the thread to understand which actions it can or cannot perform. It should also be prepared to handle any errors that it may receive when a thread is locked.
</Update>

<Update label="Increase Auto Moderation Keyword Limits" description="February 08, 2023">
  * Increase maximum number of rules with `KEYWORD` [trigger\_type](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-types) per guild from 5 to 6
  * Increase maximum length for each keyword in the `keyword_filter` and `allow_list` [trigger\_metadata](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-metadata) fields from 30 to 60.
</Update>

<Update label="Guild Audit Log Events" description="January 18, 2023">
  At long last, a new [`GUILD_AUDIT_LOG_ENTRY_CREATE`](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#guild-audit-log-entry-create) event has been added to the gateway, allowing your application to react to moderation actions in guilds. The `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG` permission is required in order to receive these events, and the [`GUILD_MODERATION` intent](/developers/docs/events/gateway#gateway-intents) needs to be set when connecting to the gateway.
</Update>

<Update label="Thread Member Details and Pagination" description="January 09, 2023" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  A new `member` field was added to the [thread member object](/developers/docs/resources/channel#thread-member-object). `member` is a [guild member object](/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-member-object) that will be included within returned thread member objects when the new `with_member` field is set to `true` in the [List Thread Members](/developers/docs/resources/channel#list-thread-members) (`GET /channels/<channel_id>/thread-members`) and [Get Thread Member](/developers/docs/resources/channel#get-thread-member) (`GET /channels/<channel_id>/thread-members/<user_id>`) endpoints.

  Setting `with_member` to `true` will also enable pagination for the [List Thread Members](/developers/docs/resources/channel#list-thread-members) endpoint. When the results are paginated, you can use the new `after` and `limit` fields to fetch additional thread members and limit the number of thread members returned. By default, `limit` is 100.

  #### Upcoming Changes

  Starting in API v11, [List Thread Members](/developers/docs/resources/channel#list-thread-members) (`GET /channels/<channel_id>/thread-members`) will *always* return paginated results, regardless of whether `with_member` is passed or not.
</Update>

<Update label="Add Default Layout setting for Forum channels" description="December 13, 2022">
  `default_forum_layout` is an optional field in the [channel object](/developers/docs/resources/channel) that indicates the default layout for posts in a [forum channel](/developers/docs/topics/threads#forums). A value of 1 (`LIST_VIEW`) indicates that posts will be displayed as a chronological list, and 2 (`GALLERY_VIEW`) indicates they will be displayed as a collection of tiles. If `default_forum_layout` hasn't been set, the value will be `0`.

  Setting `default_forum_layout` requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission.
</Update>

<Update label="Add Application Connections Metadata and Linked Roles" description="December 12, 2022">
  Introducing [linked roles](https://discord.com/blog/connected-accounts-functionality-boost-linked-roles) as well as the ability for all developers to set up their own linked roles with an application. This includes:

  * New [`role_connections_verification_url`](/developers/docs/resources/application#application-object) that can be set in the developer portal in order for the application to render as potential verification option for linked roles.
  * [Application metadata](/developers/docs/resources/application-role-connection-metadata#application-role-connection-metadata-object) to specify more detailed linked role requirements.
  * New endpoints to [retrieve](/developers/docs/resources/application-role-connection-metadata#get-application-role-connection-metadata-records) (`GET /applications/<application.id>/role-connections/metadata`) and [update](/developers/docs/resources/application-role-connection-metadata#update-application-role-connection-metadata-records) (`PUT /applications/<application.id>/role-connections/metadata`) application connection metadata.
  * New [`role_connections.write`](/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) OAuth2 scope required to authenticate the below requests.
  * Endpoints to [retrieve](/developers/docs/resources/user#get-current-user-application-role-connection) (`GET /users/@me/applications/{application.id}/role-connection`) and [update](/developers/docs/resources/user#update-current-user-application-role-connection) (`PUT /users/@me/applications/{application.id}/role-connection`) a user's role connections, both of which return an [application role connection](/developers/docs/resources/user#application-role-connection-object) object.

  <Info>
  For a quick rundown on how to get started using linked roles, refer to the [tutorial](/developers/docs/tutorials/configuring-app-metadata-for-linked-roles).
  </Info>
</Update>

<Update label="Add Auto Moderation Allow List for Keyword Rules and Increase Max Keyword Rules Per Guild Limit" description="November 22, 2022">
  * Auto Moderation rules with [trigger\_type](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-types) `KEYWORD` now support an `allow_list` field in its [trigger\_metadata](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-metadata). Any message content that matches an `allow_list` keyword will be ignored by the Auto Moderation `KEYWORD` rule. Each `allow_list` keyword can be a multi-word phrase and can contain [wildcard symbols](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-keyword-matching-strategies).
  * Increase maximum number of rules with `KEYWORD` [trigger\_type](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-types) per guild from 3 to 5
  * Increase maximum length for each regex pattern in the `regex_patterns` [trigger\_metadata](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-metadata) field from 75 to 260.
</Update>

<Update label="Upcoming Application Command Permission Changes" description="November 17, 2022" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  Based on feedback, we’re updating permissions for [application commands](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands) to simplify permission management and to make command permissions more closely resemble other permissions systems in Discord.

  Server admins can begin to opt-in to the command permission changes outlined here on a per-server basis **starting on December 16, 2022**. However, changes will not be applied to all servers **until late January or early February**.

  <Info>
  Current permissions behavior is documented in [the application commands documentation](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#permissions) and in [the changelog for the previous permissions update](/developers/docs/change-log#updated-command-permissions)
  </Info>

  These changes are focused on how configured permissions are used by Discord clients, so most apps will be unaffected. However, if your app uses the [Update Permissions endpoint](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#edit-application-command-permissions) (`PUT /applications/<application_id>/guilds/<guild_id>/commands/<command_id>/permissions`), you may need to make updates and should read these changes carefully.

  #### Types of command permission configurations

  <Info>
  The following information isn’t changing, but it’s helpful context to understand the changes.
  </Info>

  Discord’s clients determine whether a user can see or invoke a command based on three different permission configurations:

  * **Command-level permissions** are set up by an admin for a specific *command* in their server. These permissions affect only a specific command.
  * **App-level permissions** are set up by an admin for a specific *app* in their server. These permissions affect all commands for an app.
  * **`default_member_permissions`** are set up by an app when creating or updating a command. `default_member_permissions` apply to that command in *all* servers (unless an override exists). More information about `default_member_permissions` is [in the documentation](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-permissions-object-using-default-permissions).

  The concepts of these permission configurations are not changing. But then of course, the question becomes…

  ### What's changing?

  There are two changes around command permissions:

  1. The logic used to apply permission configurations to a user in a given context within Discord clients
  2. New `APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2` guild feature flag to indicate whether that guild is using the old permissions logic or the new (upcoming) logic.

  Let's go deeper into both of these.

  #### 1. How permission configurations are applied in Discord

  ##### Current behavior:

  Currently, these systems are **mutually-exclusive**, meaning that only one type of permission configuration is used to determine whether a user can invoke a command.

  With this current system, there is a clear hierarchy: command-level permission configurations take precedence (if present), then app-level permission configurations (if present), and finally `default_member_permissions` if neither are present.

  The implication of the current permissions system means that:

  * If any command-level permissions are configured, all app-level permissions and `default_member_permissions` are ignored for that command.
  * If any app-level permissions are configured, `default_member_permissions` is ignored for *all* of that app’s commands.

  This system leads to unintentional permission escalations, and can force moderators to manually re-define their app-level configurations to make small tweaks on the command-level.

  ##### Upcoming behavior:

  The new system removes the mutual exclusion aspect, meaning that the different types of permission configurations work together rather than independently—specifically, more than one may be used to determine whether a user can invoke a command.

  **`default_member_permissions` continues to act as a “default” that a developer can set when creating or updating a command.**

  **App-level permission configurations now act as the "base" configuration.**

  App-level configurations define who is allowed to use the app and where. These will work *together* with  `default_member_permissions`, meaning if a user is granted access via an app-level permission configuration, they will still be restricted to the `default_member_permissions` for each command (by default). No more accidentally granting `/ban` which requires `BAN_MEMBERS` to `@BotMemers` just because you gave them access to the app!

  **Command-level permission configurations now act as an “override” of the app-level.**

  Command-level configurations override what is present at the app-level *and* any restrictions set by `default_member_permissions`. This means that an admin can explicitly grant a user access to a specific command even if they are denied access on the app-level *or* if they don't have permissions that meet that command's `default_member_permissions`.

  If a command-level configuration does not exist for the given context, the system will fall back to looking at the app-level configuration.

  ##### Flowchart for command permissions logic

  Below is a simplified flowchart that illustrates how permissions will be applied by the Discord client after the new changes take effect.

  #### 2. `APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2` Guild Feature

  We added a new [`APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2` feature flag](/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-object-guild-features) which indicates whether that server is using **the current permissions logic**.

  * If the flag *is* present, that server is using the old command permissions behavior.
  * If the flag *is not* present, that server has migrated from the old command permissions behavior to the new behavior.

  ### Am I affected?

  Your app will only be affected if it uses the [`PUT /applications/<application_id>/guilds/<guild_id>/commands/<command_id>/permissions`](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#edit-application-command-permissions) endpoint. This is a pretty restricted endpoint used to manage and update application command permissions on behalf of admins, meaning that it requires the `applications.commands.permissions.update` scope.

  **If your app doesn’t use this endpoint, there’s nothing you need to prepare for these changes.**

  If your app does use this endpoint, you should read the section on preparing for changes below.

  ### How do I prepare for the changes?

  To prepare for these changes, you should take two steps:

  **1. Use the  `APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2` flag**

  Use this flag to determine which permissions logic that server is using. While the transition from the old behavior to the new behavior is happening, you may need two code paths depending on if the flag is present or not.

  ```py
  if 'APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2' in guild.features:
       # Use current behaviors when interacting with endpoint
  else:
       # Use new permissions behaviors when interacting with endpoint
  ```

  <Info>
  If you don’t have access to guild features already through Gateway events, you can fetch that information using the [`GET /guilds/<guild_id>` endpoint](/developers/docs/resources/guild#get-guild).
  </Info>

  **2. Modify the behavior based on your use case**

  After you know what permissions behavior the server is using, you should update how you handle that server specifically.

  To understand what changes you need to make, you should look at the assumptions users have when your app updates their server’s commands permissions. Do you have a web dashboard where admins update permissions? If so, analyze the logic of that dashboard and what your permission configurations are trying to do to map them to the new permissions behavior. Do you document what your app is doing in regards to certain command permissions you’re configuring on behalf of the admin? If so, map that documentation to the new behavior.

  If you are unsure, you can communicate with your admin users to ask if your new logic meets their expectations.

  #### What happens if I don’t update my app?

  If your app is affected and you don’t update it, permissions behavior that your app configures may not match what you or the users of your app expect.

  #### How long do I have to update my app?

  The new `APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_V2` flag is already live, and you should start seeing it in guilds’ feature flags.

  The new permissions behavior will roll out **on December 16, 2022**. On this date, admins will begin to see a banner that allows them to *optionally* move their server to the new behavior.

  In **late January or early February**, all servers will be migrated to the new behavior. We'll post another changelog at this point, at which time you can remove any logic around the old permissions behavior.

<Update label="GameSDK Feature Deprecation" description="November 09, 2022" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  To help keep us focused on the features, improvements, and gaming-related experiences that Discord users love, we are deprecating the following pieces of the GameSDK **starting today**, and decommissioning them on **Tuesday, May 2, 2023**:

   * [Achievements](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Achievements.md)
   * [Applications](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Applications.md)
   * [Voice](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Discord_Voice.md)
   * [Images](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Images.md)
   * [Lobbies](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Lobbies.md)
   * [Networking](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Networking.md)
   * [Relationships](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Relationships.md)
   * [Storage](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Storage.md)
   * [Store](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Store.mdmd)

  This deprecation period will last until **Tuesday May 2, 2023**, after which these pieces will be decommissioned and no longer work. The other pieces of the GameSDK will continue to be supported.

  We know that Discord is an important place for people to find belonging, and that using your Discord identity in games is a crucial part of that sense of belonging. You’ll still be able to use the GameSDK to integrate Rich Presence, relationships, entitlements, basic user information, and the overlay.

<Update label="Add Auto Moderation Regex Support" description="November 04, 2022">
  Auto Moderation rules with [trigger\_type](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-types) `KEYWORD` now support
  a `regex_patterns` field in its [trigger\_metadata](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-types).
  Regex patterns are a powerful way to describe many keywords all at once using one expression. Only Rust flavored regex is supported, which can be tested in online editors such as [Rustexp](https://rustexp.lpil.uk/).
</Update>

<Update label="Delete Ephemeral Messages" description="October 20, 2022">
  Ephemeral interaction responses and follow-ups can now be deleted with a valid interaction token using the following endpoints:

  * [`DELETE /webhooks/<application_id>/<interaction_token>/messages/@original`](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#delete-original-interaction-response)
  * [`DELETE /webhooks/<application_id>/<interaction_token>/messages/<message_id>`](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#delete-followup-message)

  As a reminder, interaction tokens stay valid for up to 15 minutes after the interaction occurs. Details can be found in the [interaction documentation](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding).
</Update>

<Update label="New Select Menu Components" description="October 13, 2022">
  Four new select menu [component types](/developers/docs/components/reference#component-object-component-types) have been added to make it easier to populate selects with common resources in Discord:

  * User select (type `5`)
  * Role select (type `6`)
  * Mentionable (user *and* role) select (type `7`)
  * Channel select (type `8`)

  The new select menu components are defined similarly to the existing string select menu—with the exception of not including the `options` field and, within channel select menus, having the option to include a `channel_types` field. The [select menu interaction](/developers/docs/components/reference#string-select-string-select-interaction) apps receive also contain a [`resolved` field](/developers/docs/components/reference#string-select-select-menu-resolved-object) for the new components.

  More details can be found in the updated [select menu documentation](/developers/docs/components/reference#component-object-component-types).
</Update>

<Update label="Default Sort Order for Forum Channels" description="September 22, 2022">
  `default_sort_order` is an optional field in the [channel object](/developers/docs/resources/channel) that indicates how the threads in a [forum channel](/developers/docs/topics/threads#forums) will be sorted for users by default. Setting `default_sort_order` requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission.

  If `default_sort_order` hasn't been set, its value will be `null`.
</Update>

<Update label="Auto Moderation Spam and Mention Spam Trigger Types" description="September 21, 2022">
  Two new [trigger types](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-types) were added to Auto Moderation:

  * `MENTION_SPAM` blocks messages that mention more than a set number of unique server members or roles. Apps can define the number (up to 50) using the `mention_total_limit` field in the [trigger metadata object](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#auto-moderation-rule-object-trigger-metadata) when creating or updating an Auto Moderation rule.
  * `SPAM` blocks links and messages that are identified as spam.

  More information can be found in the [Auto Moderation documentation](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation).
</Update>

<Update label="Forum Channels Release" description="September 14, 2022">
  Forum channels ([`GUILD_FORUM` or `15`](/developers/docs/resources/channel#channel-object-channel-types)) have been released to all community servers. `GUILD_FORUM` channels are a new channel type that only supports threads, which display differently than in text (`GUILD_TEXT`) channels.

  Check out the [forums topic](/developers/docs/topics/threads#forums) for more information on the relevant APIs and technical details, and the [Forums FAQ](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ#h_01G69FJQWTWN88HFEHK7Z6X79N) for more about the feature.
</Update>

<Update label="Message Content is a Privileged Intent" description="September 01, 2022" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  As of today, [message content](/developers/docs/events/gateway#message-content-intent) is a privileged intent for all verified apps *and* apps eligible for verification. More details about why it's becoming a privileged intent and how to apply for it is in the [Help Center FAQ](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Privileged-Intent-FAQ).

  Any app that does not have the message content intent configured in its app's settings within the Developer Portal will receive empty values in fields that expose message content across Discord's APIs (including the `content`, `embeds`, `attachments`, and `components` fields). These restrictions do not apply for messages that a bot or app sends, in DMs that it receives, or in messages in which it is mentioned.

  #### If your app is verified

  Verified apps and verification-eligible apps must be approved for the message content intent to receive message content. If your verified app isn’t approved, or doesn’t account for the new message content restrictions, it will break for users.

  ##### Temporary Message Content Intent

  Verified apps or apps that have submitted for verification can temporarily opt-in to a grace period which will allow your app to continue receiving message content until October 1.  However, if you opt-in to the grace period, your app will be prevented from joining any additional servers until you opt-out. More details are in the [Help Center article](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8561391080471).

  #### If your app is unverified

  Unverified apps must still must enable the intent in your app’s settings within the Developer Portal.

  Existing unverified apps will automatically have the message content intent toggled on in their settings. New unverified apps will have to manually toggle the intent in the Developer Portal.
</Update>

<Update label="Slash Command Mentions" description="August 22, 2022">
  This week, [Slash Command mentions](/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting) are rolling out across all Discord clients (for Android, mentions are limited to the [React Native client](https://discord.com/blog/android-react-native-framework-update)). Clicking a Slash Command mention will auto-populate the command in the user's message input.

  Slash Command mentions use the following format: `</NAME:COMMAND_ID>`. You can also use `</NAME SUBCOMMAND:ID>` and `</NAME SUBCOMMAND_GROUP SUBCOMMAND:ID>` for subcommands and subcommand groups.
</Update>

<Update label="Session-specific Gateway Resume URLs" description="August 09, 2022">
  <Warning>
  Starting on **September 12, 2022**, apps that aren’t using the new `resume_gateway_url` field to resume gateway sessions will be disconnected significantly faster than normal.
  </Warning>

  A new `resume_gateway_url` field has been added to the [Ready](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#ready) gateway event to support session-specific gateway connections. The value of `resume_gateway_url` is a session-specific URL that should be used when resuming the gateway session after a disconnect. Previously, `wss://gateway.discord.gg` was used to connect *and* resume sessions, but should now only be used during the connection.

  At the moment, the value of `resume_gateway_url` will always be `wss://gateway.discord.gg` to give developers more time to adopt the new field. In the near future, the value will change to the session-specific URLs.
</Update>

<Update label="Upcoming Permissions Change to Webhook Routes" description="July 13, 2022">
  On August 8th, 2022 we will begin requiring the `VIEW_CHANNEL (1 << 10)` permission for webhook routes which require `MANAGE_WEBHOOKS (1 << 29)`, to align with our documented behavior. We don't expect that many applications will be affected by this, but in case you are, please ensure you have updated permissions needed for accessing the following routes:

  * [`GET /webhooks/{webhook.id}`](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#get-webhook)
  * [`DELETE /webhooks/{webhook.id}`](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#delete-webhook)
  * [`PATCH /webhooks/{webhook.id}`](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#modify-webhook)
  * [`GET /channels/{channel.id}/webhooks`](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#get-channel-webhooks)
  * [`POST /channels/{channel.id}/webhooks`](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#create-webhook)
</Update>

<Update label="Add Subcommand Groups and Subcommands to Message Interaction Objects" description="July 01, 2022" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  While this is a breaking change, most apps only rely on interaction responses (`INTERACTION_CREATE`), *not* message interaction objects (`MESSAGE_CREATE`). [Interaction responses](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-data) are unaffected by this change.

  #### Upcoming Changes

  Starting **July 18, 2022**, the `name` field for [message interaction objects](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#message-interaction-object) will now include subcommands and subcommand groups in the value (along with the existing top-level command). In the future, we recommend not relying on this message interaction field.

  The format of the value will be the different command levels (if they exist), separated by spaces:
  `<command name> <subcommand group name> <subcommand name>`

  The `name` field is only seen on messages that are a response to an interaction without an existing message, so interaction objects for message components don’t include this field.

  #### Updating your app

  Most apps only rely on interaction responses, not message interaction objects.

  We don't recommend that your app relies on the `name` field for message interactions objects, but if it does you should update your app to handle subcommands and subcommand groups that your app may encounter.

  As an example of the change, pretend your app had a command `/role` with subcommands `add` and `remove`. Currently, the `name` field in the original interaction payload would contain `role`. If you responded to that interaction with a message then fetched its contents, the `name` field for that message interaction object would contain `role` as well.

  After this change, the `name` field for the original interaction payload will still contain `role`. However, now if you responded to that interaction with a message then fetched its contents, the `name` field for that message interaction object would contain `role add` or `role remove`.
</Update>

<Update label="Min and Max Length for Command Options" description="July 01, 2022">
  Application [command options](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-option-structure) of type `STRING` now includes optional `min_length` and `max_length` fields to control the length of text a user can input.

  The value of `min_length` must be greater or equal to `0`, and the value of `max_length` must be greater or equal to `1`.
</Update>

<Update label="Calculated Permissions in Interaction Payloads" description="June 29, 2022">
  Interaction payloads now contain an `app_permissions` field whose value is the computed [permissions](/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permissions-bitwise-permission-flags) for a bot or app in the context of a specific interaction (including any channel overwrites). Similar to other permission fields, the value of `app_permissions` is a bitwise OR-ed set of permissions expressed as a string. Read details in the [interactions documentation](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object).

  For apps without a bot user (or without the `bot` scope), the value of `app_permissions` will be the same as the permissions for `@everyone`, but limited to the permissions that can be used in interaction responses (currently `ATTACH_FILES`, `EMBED_LINKS`, `MENTION_EVERYONE`, and `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS`).
</Update>

<Update label="Changes to Bot Permissions for Interactions and Webhooks" description="June 29, 2022" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  #### Upcoming Changes

  <Warning>
  `MENTION_EVERYONE`, `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` and `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS` are the only permissions that will be affected by this change. In a previous version of this changelog, it was indicated that `ATTACH_FILES` and `EMBED_LINKS` would be affected but this is no longer the case.
  </Warning>

  Starting **August 3, 2022**, the way some of a bot's `MENTION_EVERYONE`, `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` and `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS` [permissions](/developers/docs/topics/permissions) are calculated is changing in two cases:

  * When **responding to an [interaction](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding)** (like application commands or message components)
  * When **executing a [webhook](/developers/docs/resources/webhook) that the bot created**

  Going forward, in the above cases, a bot’s `MENTION_EVERYONE`, `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` and `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS` permissions will be calculated based on the permissions its granted, *including* any [overwrites](/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permission-overwrites). Previously, a bot’s permissions in these cases relied only on those granted to `@everyone`.

  This change *only* applies to bots. The permissions for an app without a bot user (or without the `bot` scope) will still depend on `@everyone`.

  #### Updating Your App

  If your bot wants to use the `MENTION_EVERYONE`, `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` or `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS` permissions when responding to interactions or executing a webhook, **ensure that the bot was installed (or explicitly granted) with them**.

  Note that even if your bot is installed with certain permissions, they can be changed using overwrites. For interactions, you can use the [`app_permissions` field](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-structure) to determine your app or bot's contextual permissions before replying.
</Update>

<Update label="Message Content in Auto Moderation events" description="June 21, 2022" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  In API v10, the `MESSAGE_CONTENT` (`1 << 15`) intent is now required to receive non-empty values for the `content` and `matched_content` fields in [`AUTO_MODERATION_ACTION_EXECUTION`](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#auto-moderation-action-execution) gateway events. This matches the intended behavior for message content across the API.
</Update>

<Update label="Updated Connection Property Field Names" description="June 17, 2022">
  The `$` prefix in [identify connection properties](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#identify-identify-connection-properties) are deprecated. The new field names are `os`, `browser`, and `device`. When passed, the `$`-prefixed names will resolve to the new ones.

  In API v11, support for the previous field names (`$os`, `$browser`, and `$device`) will be removed.
</Update>

<Update label="Auto Moderation" description="June 16, 2022">
  Add new [Auto Moderation feature](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation) which enables guilds to moderate message content based on keywords, harmful links, and unwanted spam. This change includes:

  * New endpoints for [creating](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#create-auto-moderation-rule), [updating](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#modify-auto-moderation-rule), and [deleting](/developers/docs/resources/auto-moderation#delete-auto-moderation-rule) Auto Moderation rules
  * New gateway events emitted when Auto Moderation rules are [created](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#auto-moderation-rule-create) (`AUTO_MODERATION_RULE_CREATE`), [updated](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#auto-moderation-rule-update) (`AUTO_MODERATION_RULE_UPDATE `), and [deleted](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#auto-moderation-rule-delete) (`AUTO_MODERATION_RULE_DELETE `). Requires the `AUTO_MODERATION_CONFIGURATION` (`1 << 20`) intent
  * New gateway event emitted when an [action is executed](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#auto-moderation-action-execution) (`AUTO_MODERATION_ACTION_EXECUTION`). Requires the `AUTO_MODERATION_EXECUTION` (`1 << 21`) intent
  * New [audit log entries](/developers/docs/resources/audit-log#audit-log-entry-object-audit-log-events) when rules are created (`AUTO_MODERATION_RULE_CREATE`), updated (`AUTO_MODERATION_RULE_UPDATE`), or deleted (`AUTO_MODERATION_RULE_DELETE`), or when Auto Moderation performs an action (`AUTO_MODERATION_BLOCK_MESSAGE`)
</Update>

<Update label="Updated Command Permissions" description="April 27, 2022" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  Application command permissions have been updated to add more granular control and access to commands in Discord. You can read the major changes below, and [the updated documentation](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#permissions) for details.

  #### Breaking changes

  * Bearer tokens are now required to edit command permissions. Bearer tokens are tokens tied to an authenticating user's permissions, and can be [retrieved using OAuth](/developers/docs/topics/oauth2). The user must have permission to manage the guild and roles.
  * [`applications.commands.permissions.update`](/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) scope was added as a requirement to edit command permissions.
  * Disabled the batch editing endpoint ([`PUT /applications/{application.id}/guilds/{guild.id}/commands/permissions`](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#batch-edit-application-command-permissions)).

  #### Other changes

  * Created a [`CHANNEL` command permission type](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-permissions-object-application-command-permission-type)
  * Increase permission limit from `10` to `100`
  * [constant (`guild_id - 1`)](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-permissions-object-application-command-permissions-constants) to represent all channels in command permissions
  * Added `default_member_permissions` field, which is a bitwise OR-ed set of [permissions](/developers/docs/topics/permissions#permissions-bitwise-permission-flags), expressed as a string. This replaces the `default_permission` field, which will soon be deprecated.
  * Added `dm_permission`, which is a boolean flag used to indicate whether a command is available in DMs (only for global application commands). If no value is passed, the global command will be visible in DMs.
  * Added `APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_UPDATE` [gateway](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#application-command-permissions-update) event and `APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSION_UPDATE` [audit log](/developers/docs/resources/audit-log) event.
</Update>

<Update label="Forum Channels" description="April 06, 2022">
  Added new channel type, `GUILD_FORUM` (15). A `GUILD_FORUM` channel is an unreleased feature that is very similar (from an API perspective) to a `GUILD_TEXT` channel, except only threads can be created in that channel; messages cannot be sent directly in that channel. Check out the [forums topic](/developers/docs/topics/threads#forums) for more information.
</Update>

<Update label="Guild Bans Pagination" description="March 31, 2022">
  The `GET /guilds/{guild.id}/bans` endpoint has been migrated to require pagination to improve reliability and stability. Check out the [endpoint docs](/developers/docs/resources/guild#get-guild-bans) for more information.
</Update>

<Update label="API v10" description="February 14, 2022">
  * API v8 is now deprecated.
  * `GET /channels/{channel.id}/threads/active` is decommissioned in favor of [`GET /guilds/{guild.id}/threads/active`](/developers/docs/resources/guild#list-active-guild-threads).
  * Starting in v10, you must specify the message content intent (`1 << 15`) to receive content-related fields in message dispatches. Read more in the [Gateway Intents documentation](/developers/docs/events/gateway#gateway-intents).
  * To specify a reason for an administrative action in audit logs, apps must now pass the `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header rather than the `reason` parameter for all endpoints. Read more in the [Audit Logs documentation](/developers/docs/resources/audit-log).
  * Message routes (like [`POST /channels/{channel.id}/messages`](/developers/docs/resources/message#create-message)) now use the `embeds` field (an array of embed objects) instead of `embed`.
  * The `summary` field for [applications](/developers/docs/resources/application) now returns an empty string for all API versions.
  * The `name` and `description` fields for [Achievements](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Achievements.md#achievement-struct) are now strings, and localization info is now passed in new `name_localizations` and `description_localizations` dictionaries. This change standardizes localization to match [Application Commands](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#localization). Read details in the [Achievements documentation](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Achievements.md#achievement-struct).
  * Existing attachments must be specified when [`PATCH`ing messages with new attachments](/developers/docs/reference#editing-message-attachments). Any attachments not specified will be removed and replaced with the specified list
  * Requests to v10 and higher will no longer be supported on `discordapp.com` (this does **not** affect `cdn.discordapp.com`)

  #### Upcoming changes

  * API v6 and v7 will be decommissioned **in early 2023**
  * `MESSAGE_CONTENT` is becoming a privileged intent for verified bots in 75+ servers **on August 31, 2022**. Read details in [the FAQ](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Privileged-Intent-FAQ) or follow [the guide](/developers/docs/tutorials/upgrading-to-application-commands) on updating your app.
  * The `summary` field for applications will be removed in the next API version (v11)
</Update>

<Update label="Interaction Modals and Application Command Attachment Option Type" description="February 08, 2022">
  Interaction modals are now available, allowing applications to prompt users for further detailed input. Check out [the modal docs](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-modal) for more information.

  Application Commands can now add an attachment option type. See [the option type table](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-option-type) for more information.
</Update>

<Update label="Guild Member Timeouts" description="December 20, 2021">
  Add new documentation for the recently released guild member timeout feature.
</Update>

<Update label="Guild Scheduled Events" description="November 23, 2021">
  * Add official support for `guild_scheduled_events` field on `Guild` resource sent with `GUILD_CREATE` event

  #### Nov 18, 2021

  * Breaking change for return type for `GET /guilds/{guild.id}/scheduled-events/{guild_scheduled_event.id}/users`
  * Add `with_user_count` query param for `GET /guilds/{guild.id}/scheduled-events/{guild_scheduled_event.id}`
  * Return additional `creator` field by default in response for `GET /guilds/{guild.id}/scheduled-events/{guild_scheduled_event.id}`
  * More details and clarification for the guild scheduled events feature.
  * Document support for `before` and `after` query params for `GET /guilds/{guild.id}/scheduled-events/{guild_scheduled_event.id}/users`

  #### Nov 15, 2021

  Add new documentation for the recently released Guild Scheduled Events feature.
</Update>

<Update label="Application Command Autocomplete Interactions" description="October 27, 2021">
  Autocomplete interactions are now available, allowing application commands to provide server completed options. Check out [the autocomplete interaction docs](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#autocomplete) for more information.
</Update>

<Update label="Updated Thread Permissions" description="September 16, 2021">
  Thread permissions have been updated and simplified:

  * "Use Public Threads" is now "Create Public Threads", which allows users to create public threads and announcement threads in a channel, even if they cannot send messages in that channel.
  * "Use Private Threads" is now "Create Private Threads", which allows users to create private threads in a channel, even if they cannot send messages in that channel.

  A new permission has also been added:

  * "Send Messages in Threads", which allows users to send a message in a thread. The "Send Messages" permission has no effect in threads: users **must** have "Send Messages in Threads" to send a message in a thread. This allows for setups where a user can participate in a thread but cannot send a message in the parent channel (like a thread on an announcement post).
</Update>

<Update label="User and Message Commands" description="August 10, 2021">
  [User commands](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#user-commands) and [message commands](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#message-commands) are now live! These commands appear on context menus for users and messages, with more to come in the future.

  Context menu commands are a type of application command. The "Slash Commands" documentation page has been renamed to "Application Commands" and split out by type to show this.
</Update>

<Update label="Select Menu Components" description="June 30, 2021">
  Select Menus are now part of the components API! They're the greatest thing since the invention of buttons yesterday. Select menus allow you to offer users a choice of one or many options in a friendly UI-based way.

  Select menus can be used like other [message components](/developers/docs/components/overview). Learn all the specifics in the [documentation](/developers/docs/components/reference#string-select).
</Update>

<Update label="Support for Multiple Embeds in Message Routes" description="June 10, 2021">
  Message routes now accept an embeds array in addition to the existing embed field. Bots can now send up to 10 embeds per message, to be consistent with webhook behavior. The existing embed field is considered deprecated and will be removed in the next API version.
</Update>

<Update label="Buttons and Message Components" description="May 26, 2021">
  Message components are now available with our first two components: a layout-based `ActionRow` and...buttons!

  You can now include buttons on messages sent by your app, whether they're bot messages or responses to interactions. [Learn more about message components](/developers/docs/components/overview).

  The addition of message components means new fields and response types:

  * An optional `components` field has been added to the [message object](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-object)
  * New response types `6` and `7` have been added for [interaction responses](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-type), valid only for component-based interactions
</Update>

<Update label="API v9" description="April 28, 2021">
  API v9 is now available.

  API v9 includes support for [threads](/developers/docs/topics/threads), an upcoming feature.  Older API versions will not receive any Gateway Events for threads, so it is important to update soon!  We've prepared a [migration guide](/developers/docs/topics/threads) to help make the upgrade process very straightforward.

  This documentation is being published early so bots can have at least two months to upgrade before threads launch.

  Additionally, API v9 also removes the `/channels/:id/messages/:id/suppress-embeds` route.
</Update>

<Update label="Application Command Permissions" description="April 05, 2021">
  Need to keep some of your commands safe from prying eyes, or only available to the right people? Commands now support [command permissions](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#permissions)!

  You can enable or disable a command (guild or global) for a specific user or role in a guild. For now, users will still be able to see the commands, but won't be able to use them.

  New routes have been added to support this functionality:

  * [`GET Guild Application Command Permissions`](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#get-guild-application-command-permissions)
  * [`GET Application Command Permissions`](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#get-application-command-permissions)
  * [`PUT Application Command Permissions`](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#batch-edit-application-command-permissions)

  A `default_permission` field has also been added to the [ApplicationCommand](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-structure) model. This field allows you to disable commands for everyone in a guild by default, if you prefer to make some of your commands an opt-in experience.
</Update>

<Update label="Large Bot Sharding Lowered to 150,000 Guilds" description="March 15, 2021">
  There have been reports that sessions have higher frequency of errors when starting if a bot has joined too many guilds (the gateway connection times out). To account for this we have lowered the requirement for large bot sharding down to 150,000 guilds in order to improve reliability.
</Update>

<Update label="Changes to Slash Command Response Types and Flags" description="March 05, 2021">
  Changes to interaction response types have been made to support better designs for application commands:

  * Type `2` `Acknowledge` has been deprecated
  * Type `3` `ChannelMessage` has been deprecated
  * Type `5` `AcknowledgeWithSource` has been renamed to `DeferredChannelMessageWithSource`

  These deprecated types will be removed and break on **April 9, 2021**.

  Additionally, `flags` has been documented on [InteractionApplicationCommandCallbackData](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-data-structure). Setting `flags` to `64` will make the interaction response ephemeral.
</Update>

<Update label="Slash Commands in DMs" description="February 09, 2021">
  Slash Commands are now supported in DMs with bots. Due to this change, some of the fields on the [Interaction object](/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-structure) have been made optional. Newly optional fields don't reflect any behavior changes in Slash Commands within guilds; they are to support commands in the context of a DM only.
</Update>

<Update label="Change to Permission Checking when Creating Channels" description="January 22, 2021">
  Permission overwrites in the guild channel creation endpoint are now validated against the permissions your bot has in the guild. Permission overwrites specified in the request body when creating guild channels will now require your bot to also have the permissions being applied. Setting `MANAGE_ROLES` permission in channel overwrites is only possible for guild administrators or users with `MANAGE_ROLES` as a permission overwrite in the channel.
</Update>

<Update label="Slash Commands and Interactions" description="December 15, 2020">
  Slash Commands are here! There's a *lot* to cover, so go check out specific documentation under [Slash Commands](/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands).

  Slash Commands include some new features for webhooks as well:

  * Webhooks can now update previously-sent messages from the same webhook using [Edit Webhook Message](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#edit-webhook-message) and [Delete Webhook Message](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#delete-webhook-message)

  This PR also documents the `application` field on the `READY` gateway event, which is a partial [application object](/developers/docs/resources/application#application-object) containing `id` and `flags`.
</Update>

<Update label="Inline Replies" description="November 16, 2020">
  Inline Replies have been added to our documentation. They behave differently in v6 and v8, so be cautious in your implementation:

  * Inline replies are type `19` in v8, but remain type `0` in v6
  * You can now add a `message_reference` on message create to create a reply
  * A new field `referenced_message` has been added to the [Message Object](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-object)
  * A new field `replied_user` has been added to the [Allowed Mentions Object](/developers/docs/resources/message#allowed-mentions-object)
  * [Message Create](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#message-create) gateway event is guaranteed to have a `referenced_message` if the message created is a reply. Otherwise, that field is not guaranteed.
</Update>

<Update label="Stickers" description="November 13, 2020">
  Stickers are now documented as part of the [message](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-object) object.
</Update>

<Update label="Gateway v6 Intent Restrictions" description="October 27, 2020">
  The v6 gateway now applies the restrictions for gateway intents. This means the new chunking limitations are now in effect, regardless of intents being used. See [Request Guild Members](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#request-guild-members) for further details.
  Additionally, if privileged intents are not enabled in the application dashboard the bot will not receive the events for those intents.

  All other intents are always enabled by default unless specified otherwise by the identify payload. We have made a support article to explain some of the changes and resulting issues with more details: [Gateway Update FAQ](https://dis.gd/gwupdate)
</Update>

<Update label="API and Gateway V8" description="September 24, 2020">
  We've introduced API and Gateway v8! Changes are noted throughout the documentation, and you can also read [this commit in our docs repo](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/commit/545ff4a7883e5eee7ee91d19a5e5d760a0730033) for a full diff.

  The changes are:

  * API and Gateway v8 are now available. v6 is still the default for the time being.
  * [Gateway Intents](/developers/docs/events/gateway#gateway-intents) are now required
  * Removed `guild_subscriptions` in identify in favor of [Gateway Intents](/developers/docs/events/gateway#gateway-intents).
  * All permissions have been converted to strings-serialized numbers. As such, `permissions_new`, `allow_new`, and `deny_new` have been removed
  * The `game` field has been removed. If you need a direct replacement, you can instead reference the first element of `activities`
  * Channel Permission Overwrite `type`s are now numbers (0 and 1) instead of strings ("role" and "member"). However due to a current technical constraint, they are string-serialized numbers in audit log `options`.
  * `embed_enabled` and `embed_channel_id` have been removed. Use `widget_enabled` and `widget_channel_id` instead.
  * Form body errors have been improved to include more helpful messaging on validation. [See more here](/developers/docs/reference#error-messages)
  * The `Retry-After` header value and `retry_after` body value is now based in seconds instead of milliseconds (e.g. `123` means 123 seconds)
  * The `X-RateLimit-Precision` header is no longer respected. `X-RateLimit-Reset` and `X-RateLimit-Reset-After` are always returned at millisecond precision (e.g. `123.456` instead of `124`)
  * Bots no longer receive [Channel Create Gateway Event](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#channel-create) for DMs
  * `delete-message-days` is no longer available. Use `delete_message_days`.
  * Removed `roles`, `premium_since`, and `nick` from [Presence Update Gateway Event](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#presence-update)
  * Removed some [integration object](/developers/docs/resources/guild#integration-object) fields for Discord application integrations
  * Removed `include_applications` from [Get Guild Integrations](/developers/docs/resources/guild#get-guild-integrations). Application integrations are always included.
  * The following deprecated routes have been removed for better naming conventions:

  Removed in favor of `/guilds/<guild_id>/widget`:

  * `/guilds/<guild_id>/embed`

  Removed in favor of `/guilds/<guild_id>/widget.json`:

  * `/servers/<guild_id>/embed.json`
  * `/servers/<guild_id>/widget.json`
  * `/guilds/<guild_id>/embed.json`

  Removed in favor of `/guilds/<guild_id>/widget.png`:

  * `/guilds/<guild_id>/embed.png`

  Removed in favor of `/channels/<channel_id>/messages/bulk-delete`:

  * `/channels/<channel_id>/messages/bulk_delete/`

  Removed in favor of `/invites/<code>/`:

  * `/invite/<code>/`
</Update>

<Update label="New Permission Fields" description="July 28, 2020">
  Documented `permissions_new`, `allow_new`, and `deny_new` as string-serialized permission bitfields.
</Update>

<Update label="Legacy Mention Behavior Deprecation" description="May 11, 2020">
  The legacy mention behavior for bots is now removed, and granular control of mentions should use the [Allowed Mentions](/developers/docs/resources/message#allowed-mentions-object) API moving forwards.
</Update>

<Update label="New Properties on Guild Members Chunk Event" description="April 24, 2020">
  The [Guild Members Chunk](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#guild-members-chunk) gateway event now contains two properties: `chunk_index` and `chunk_count`. These values can be used to keep track of how many events you have left to receive in response to a [Request Guild Members](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#request-guild-members) command.
</Update>

<Update label="New Allowed Mentions Object" description="March 03, 2020">
  We've added a way to specify mentions in a more granular form. This change also begins the start of a 60 day deprecation cycle on legacy mention behavior. Read more:

  * [Allowed mentions object](/developers/docs/resources/message#allowed-mentions-object)
</Update>

<Update label="New Invite Events and Reactions Endpoint" description="March 02, 2020">
  We've added a new endpoint for deleting all reactions of a specific emoji from a message, as well as some new invite and reaction gateway events. Read more:

  * [Delete All Reactions for Emoji](/developers/docs/resources/message#delete-all-reactions-for-emoji)
  * [Invite Create](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#invite-create)
  * [Invite Delete](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#invite-delete)
  * [Message Reaction Remove Emoji](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#message-reaction-remove-emoji)
</Update>

<Update label="Rich Presence Spectate Approval" description="February 26, 2020">
  The [Spectate](/developers/docs/developer-tools/game-sdk#onactivityspectate) functionality of Rich Presence no longer requires whitelisting or approval.
</Update>

<Update label="Gateway Intents" description="February 14, 2020">
  We've added documentation around a brand new feature: [Gateway Intents!](/developers/docs/events/gateway#gateway-intents) Gateway Intents are a great way to specify which events you want to receive from our gateway. Go on, save yourself some bandwidth and CPU usage.

  Using Intents will change the behavior of some existing events and commands, so please refer to:

  * [Guild Create](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#guild-create)
  * [Request Guild Members](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#request-guild-members)
  * [Guild Member Add](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#guild-member-add)
  * [Guild Member Remove](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#guild-member-remove)
  * [Guild Member Update](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#guild-member-update)
  * [Presence Update](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#presence-update)
  * [List Guild Members](/developers/docs/resources/guild#list-guild-members)
</Update>

<Update label="IP Discovery Updates" description="December 06, 2019">
  Updated our [IP discovery message](/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections#ip-discovery). The old message is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
</Update>

<Update label="GameSDK Version 2.5.6" description="November 27, 2019">
  Fixed a bug from the 2.5.5 release that caused network handshakes to fail, resulting in no networking data being sent. The networking manager and integrated lobby networking should be full operational again after updating.
</Update>

<Update label="GameSDK Version 2.5.5" description="November 14, 2019">
  We've shipped some updates to the GameSDK, including support for Linux as well as the IL2CPP backend system for Unity. These changes also fixed a bug in the [`SetUserAchievement()`](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Achievements.md#setuserachievement) method.

  Get the latest at the top of the [Getting Started](/developers/docs/developer-tools/game-sdk#step-1-get-the-sdk) documentation. If you're looking for help interacting with the GameSDK or want to report a bug, join us on the [official Discord](https://discord.gg/discord-developers).
</Update>

<Update label="Changes to Special Channels" description="August 22, 2019">
  News Channels are now changed to Announcement Channels. Developer License owners will continue to get access to them (both existing and new). Underlying channel type (GUILD\_NEWS = 5) remains the same.
</Update>

<Update label="More Precise Rate Limits" description="August 12, 2019">
  You can now get more precise rate limit reset times, via a new request header. Check out the [rate limits](/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits) documentation for more information.
</Update>

<Update label="Bot Tokens for Achievements" description="July 18, 2019">
  You can now use Bot tokens for authorization headers against the HTTP API for [Achievements](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/developers/docs/game_sdk/Achievements.md#the-api-way).
</Update>

<Update label="Additional Team Information" description="June 19, 2019">
  Additional information around Teams has been added to both the API and the documentation. The [Teams](/developers/docs/topics/teams) page now includes information about the team and team member objects. Additionally, the [Get Current Application Information](/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#get-current-bot-application-information) endpoint now returns a `team` object if that application belongs to a team. That documentation has also been updated to includes fields that were missing for applications that are games sold on Discord.
</Update>

<Update label="Added Info Around Nitro Boosting Experiment" description="May 29, 2019">
  Additional information has been documented to support [Server Nitro Boosting](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting). This includes the addition of a few [message types](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-object-message-types), as well as some [new fields on guilds](/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-object-premium-tier). Please note that this feature is currently under experimentation, and these fields may be subject to change.
</Update>

<Update label="Deprecation of Discord-RPC Rich Presence SDK" description="April 29, 2019">
  The [Discord-RPC](https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc) implementation of Rich Presence has been deprecated in favor of Discord's new GameSDK. If you're interested in using Rich Presence, please read our [SDK Starter Guide](/developers/docs/developer-tools/game-sdk#getting-started) and check out the relevant functions in the [Activity Manager](/developers/docs/developer-tools/game-sdk#activities).
</Update>

<Update label="New Invite Object Fields" description="April 18, 2019">
  The [Invite Object](/developers/docs/resources/invite#invite-object) now includes two additional fields, `target_user` and `target_user_type`.
</Update>

<Update label="Ask to Join & Rich Presence SDK" description="January 14, 2019">
  Ask to Join no longer requires approval or whitelisting to use. You are welcome to create in-game UI, but all Ask to Join requests are also now handled by the Discord overlay.

  There have also been some small additions to the Rich Presence SDK. The previously undocumented `UpdateHandlers()` function is now documented.
</Update>

<Update label="Documentation: Dispatch Store Listings" description="December 11, 2018">
  Dispatch documentation around store listings has been removed. Store pages for the Discord Store are now managed entirely within the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers).
</Update>

<Update label="Enhancement: User Object" description="November 30, 2018">
  The [User object](/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object) now includes two new additional fields, `premium_type` and `flags`. These can be used to know the Nitro status of a user, or determine which HypeSquad house a user is in.
</Update>

<Update label="Documentation Fix: List of Open DMS in Certain Payloads" description="June 19, 2018">
  The documentation has been updated to correctly note that the `private_channels` field in the [Ready](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#ready) should be an empty array, as well as the response from `/users/@me/channels` for a bot user. This change has been in effect for a long time, but the documentation was not updated.
</Update>

<Update label="Deprecation: RPC online member count and members list" description="June 11, 2018">
  We released server changes that allow guilds to represent an incomplete state of the member list in our clients, which results in inaccurate member lists and online counts over RPC. These fields are now deprecated and will now return an empty members array and an online count of 0 moving forward.
</Update>

<Update label="Enhancement: New Message Properties" description="February 05, 2018">
  Additional `activity` and `application` fields—as well as corresponding object documentation—have been added to the [Message](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-object) object in support of our newly-released [Spotify integration](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000167212-Discord-Spotify-Connection) and previous Rich Presence enhancements.
</Update>

<Update label="Enhancement: Get Guild Emoji Endpoint" description="January 30, 2018">
  The [Get Guild Emoji](/developers/docs/resources/emoji#get-guild-emoji) response now also includes a user object if the emoji was added by a user.
</Update>

<Update label="Deprecation: Accept Invite Endpoint" description="January 23, 2018">
  The [Accept Invite](/developers/docs/resources/invite) endpoint is deprecated starting today, and will be discontinued on March 23, 2018. The [Add Guild Member](/developers/docs/resources/guild#add-guild-member) endpoint should be used in its place.
</Update>

<Update label="Semi-Breaking Change: Very Large Bot Sharding" description="January 03, 2018" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  Additional sharding requirements and information for bots in over 100,000 guilds has been added. This requires a small change in numbers of shards for affected bots. See the [documentation](/developers/docs/events/gateway#sharding-for-large-bots) for more information.
</Update>

<Update label="New Feature: Rich Presence" description="November 09, 2017">
  Rich Presence is now live and available for all developers! Rich Presence allows developers to closely integrate with Discord in a number of new, cool ways like:

  * Showing more information about a user's current game in their profile
  * Allowing users to post invitations to join their party or spectate their game in chat
  * Displaying "Spectate" and "Ask to Join" buttons on users' profiles

  For more information, check out our [Rich Presence site](https://discord.com/rich-presence). To get started on development, [read the docs](/developers/docs/rich-presence/overview)!
</Update>

<Update label="Breaking Change: API & Gateway Below v6 Discontinued" description="October 16, 2017" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  [API](/developers/docs/reference#api-versioning) and Gateway versions below v6 are now discontinued after being previously deprecated. Version 6 is now the default API and Gateway version. Attempting to use a version below 6 will result in an error.
</Update>

<Update label="New Feature: Channel Categories" description="September 20, 2017">
  Changes have been made throughout the documentation to reflect the addition of channel categories to Discord. These includes an additional field—`parent_id`—to the base [channel](/developers/docs/resources/channel#channel-object) object and a new [channel category example](/developers/docs/resources/channel#channel-object-example-channel-category).
</Update>

<Update label="New Feature: Emoji Endpoints" description="September 10, 2017">
  [Emoji endpoints](/developers/docs/resources/emoji) have been added to the API. Bots can now manage guild emojis to their robo-hearts' content!
</Update>

<Update label="Breaking Change: Presence Activity Objects" description="August 16, 2017" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  The `type` field in the [activity object](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#activity-object) for [Gateway Status Update](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#update-presence) and [Presence Update](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#presence-update) payloads is no longer optional when the activity object is not null.
</Update>

<Update label="Breaking Change: Default Channels" description="August 03, 2017" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  After today, we are changing how default channels function. The "default" channel for a given user is now the channel with the highest position that their permissions allow them to see. New guilds will no longer have a default channel with the same id as the guild. Existing guilds will not have their #general channel id changed. It is possible, if permissions are set in such a way, that a user will not have a default channel in a guild.

  We saw a use case in many servers where the previously-default #general channel was being repurposed as an announcement-only, non-writable channel for new members by using bots to clear the entire message history. Now, that channel can simply be deleted and re-created with the desired permissions. This change also allows dynamic default channels for users based on permissions.

  We are also rolling out a change in conjunction that will allow Discord to remember your last-visited channel in a guild across sessions. Newly-joined users will be directed to the guild's default channel on first join; existing members will return to whichever channel they last visited.
</Update>

<Update label="New Feature: Audit Logs" description="July 24, 2017">
  Audit logs are here! Well, they've been here all along, but now we've got [documentation](/developers/docs/resources/audit-log) about them. Check it out, but remember: with great power comes great responsibility.
</Update>

<Update label="Breaking Change: Version 6" description="July 19, 2017" tags={["Breaking Changes"]}>
  * [Channel](/developers/docs/resources/channel#channel-object) Object
    * `is_private` removed
    * [`type`](/developers/docs/resources/channel#channel-object-channel-types) is now an integer
