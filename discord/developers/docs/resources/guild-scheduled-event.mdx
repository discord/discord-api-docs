<Accordion title="System limitations" description="Recurrence rules are powerful, but they have some specific restrictions" icon="warning">
The current system limitations are present due to how reoccurring event data needs to be displayed in the client.
In the future, we would like to open the system up to have fewer / none of these restrictions.

  - `by_weekday`
  - `by_n_weekday`
  - `by_month` + `by_month_day`

<ManualAnchor id="guild-scheduled-event-recurrence-rule-object-`byweekday`" />
###### `by_weekday`
  - Only valid for daily and weekly events (`frequency` of `DAILY` (`0`) or `WEEKLY` (`1`))
  - when used in a daily event (`frequency` is `DAILY` (`0`))
    - The values present in the `by_weekday` event must be a "known set" of weekdays.
    - The following are current allowed "sets"
      - Monday - Friday (`[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`)
      - Tuesday - Saturday (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`)
      - Sunday - Thursday (`[6, 0, 1, 2, 3]`)
      - Friday & Saturday (`[4, 5]`)
      - Saturday & Sunday (`[5, 6]`)
      - Sunday & Monday (`[6, 0]`)
  - when used in a weekly event (`frequency` is `WEEKLY` (`1`))
    - `by_weekday` array currently can only be a length of `1`
      - i.e: You can only select a single day within a week to have a recurring event on
      - If you wish to have multiple days within a week have a recurring event, please use a `frequency` of `DAILY`
    - Also, see `interval` below for "every-other" week information

<ManualAnchor id="guild-scheduled-event-recurrence-rule-object-`bynweekday`" />
###### `by_n_weekday`
  - Only valid for monthly events (`frequency` of `MONTHLY` (`1`))
  - `by_n_weekday` array currently can only be a length of `1`
    - i.e: You can only select a single day within a month to have a recurring event on

<ManualAnchor id="guild-scheduled-event-recurrence-rule-object-`bymonth`-and-`bymonthday`" />
###### `by_month` and `by_month_day`
  - Only valid for annual event (`frequency` is `YEARLY` (`0`))
  - both `by_month` and `by_month_day` must be provided
  - both `by_month` and `by_month_day` arrays must have a length of `1`
    - (i.e: You can only set a single date for annual events)

###### `interval` can only be set to a value other than `1` when `frequency` is set to `WEEKLY` (`1`)
  - In this situation, interval can be set to `2`
  - This allowance enables "every-other week" events
  - Due to the limitations placed on `by_weekday` this means that if you wish to use "every-other week" functionality
    you can only do so for a single day.

\* If updating `entity_type` to `EXTERNAL`:

- `channel_id` is required and [must be set to null](/developers/docs/resources/guild-scheduled-event#guild-scheduled-event-object-field-requirements-by-entity-type)
- `entity_metadata` with a `location` field must be provided
- `scheduled_end_time` must be provided

## Delete Guild Scheduled Event
<Route method="DELETE">/guilds/[\{guild.id\}](/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-object)/scheduled-events/[\{guild_scheduled_event.id\}](/developers/docs/resources/guild-scheduled-event#guild-scheduled-event-object)</Route>

Delete a guild scheduled event. Returns a `204` on success. Fires a [Guild Scheduled Event Delete](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#guild-scheduled-event-delete) Gateway event.

## Get Guild Scheduled Event Users
<Route method="GET">/guilds/[\{guild.id\}](/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-object)/scheduled-events/[\{guild_scheduled_event.id\}](/developers/docs/resources/guild-scheduled-event#guild-scheduled-event-object)/users</Route>

Get a list of guild scheduled event users subscribed to a guild scheduled event. Returns a list of [guild scheduled event user](/developers/docs/resources/guild-scheduled-event#guild-scheduled-event-user-object) objects on success. Guild member data, if it exists, is included if the `with_member` query parameter is set.

###### Query String Params

| Field        | Type                                                        | Description                                   | Default |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|
| limit?       | number                                                      | number of users to return (up to maximum 100) | 100     |
| with_member? | [boolean](/developers/docs/reference#boolean-query-strings) | include guild member data if it exists        | false   |
| before? *    | snowflake                                                   | consider only users before given user id      | null    |
| after? *     | snowflake                                                   | consider only users after given user id       | null    |

\* Provide a user id to `before` and `after` for pagination. Users will always be returned in ascending order by `user_id`. If both `before` and `after` are provided, only `before` is respected. Fetching users in-between `before` and `after` is not supported.


## Guild Scheduled Event Status Update Automation

NOTE: `status` and `entity_type` here are expressed by name rather than their value for readability

### An active scheduled event for a stage channel where all users have left the stage channel will automatically end a few minutes after the last user leaves the channel

When an event with `'status': ACTIVE` and `'entity_type': STAGE_INSTANCE` has no users connected to the stage channel for a certain period of time (on the order of minutes), the event `status` will be automatically set to `COMPLETED`.

### An active scheduled event for a voice channel where all users have left the voice channel will automatically end a few minutes after the last user leaves the channel

When an event with `'status': ACTIVE` and `'entity_type': VOICE` has no users connected to the voice channel for a certain period of time (on the order of minutes), the event `status` will be automatically set to `COMPLETED`.

### An external event will automatically begin at its scheduled start time

An event with `'entity_type': EXTERNAL` at its `scheduled_start_time` will automatically have `status` set to `ACTIVE`.

### An external event will automatically end at its scheduled end time

An event with `'entity_type': EXTERNAL` at its `scheduled_end_time`  will automatically have `status` set to `COMPLETED`.

### Any scheduled event which has not begun after its scheduled start time will be automatically cancelled after a few hours

Any event with `'status': SCHEDULED` after a certain time interval (on the order of hours) beyond its `scheduled_start_time` will have its `status` automatically set to `CANCELLED`.

## Guild Scheduled Event Permissions Requirements

NOTE: `entity_type` is expressed by name rather than value for readability

<Info>
A user must be a member of the guild in order to access events for that guild unless the guild is lurkable. If a guild is lurkable, events in that guild may be visible to lurkers depending on the event type and the permissions of any channels associated with the event.
