Webhooks are a low-effort way to post messages to channels in Discord. They do not require a bot user or authentication to use.

Apps can also subscribe to webhook events (i.e. outgoing webhooks) when events happen *in* Discord, which is detailed in the [Webhook Events](/developers/docs/events/webhook-events) documentation.

### Webhook Object

Used to represent a webhook.

## Create Webhook
<Route method="POST">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/developers/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)/webhooks</Route>

Creates a new webhook and returns a [webhook](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#webhook-object) object on success. Requires the `MANAGE_WEBHOOKS` permission. Fires a [Webhooks Update](/developers/docs/events/gateway-events#webhooks-update) Gateway event.

An error will be returned if a webhook name (`name`) is not valid. A webhook name is valid if:

- It does not contain the substrings `clyde` or `discord` (case-insensitive)
- It follows the nickname guidelines in the [Usernames and Nicknames](/developers/docs/resources/user#usernames-and-nicknames) documentation, with an exception that webhook names can be up to 80 characters

<Info>
This endpoint supports the `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header.

## Execute Webhook
<Route method="POST">/webhooks/[\{webhook.id\}](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#webhook-object)/[\{webhook.token\}](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#webhook-object)</Route>

Refer to [Uploading Files](/developers/docs/reference#uploading-files) for details on attachments and `multipart/form-data` requests. Returns a message or `204 No Content` depending on the `wait` query parameter.

<Info>
Note that when sending a message, you must provide a value for at **least one of** `content`, `embeds`, `components`, `file`, or `poll`.
</Info>

<Info>
If the webhook channel is a forum or media channel, you must provide either `thread_id` in the query string params, or `thread_name` in the JSON/form params. If `thread_id` is provided, the message will send in that thread. If `thread_name` is provided, a thread with that name will be created in the channel.
</Info>

<Warning>
Discord may strip certain characters from message content, like invalid unicode characters or characters which cause unexpected message formatting. If you are passing user-generated strings into message content, consider sanitizing the data to prevent unexpected behavior and using `allowed_mentions` to prevent unexpected mentions.
</Warning>

\* Application-owned webhooks can always send components. Non-application-owned webhooks cannot send interactive components, and the `components` field will be ignored unless they set the `with_components` query param.

\*\* See [Uploading Files](/developers/docs/reference#uploading-files) for details.

\*\*\* When the flag `IS_COMPONENTS_V2` is set, the webhook message can only contain `components`. Providing `content`, `embeds`, `files[n]` or `poll` will fail with a 400 BAD REQUEST response.

<Info>
For the webhook embed objects, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.

[Add a new webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) to your GitHub repo (in the repo's settings), and use this endpoint as the "Payload URL." You can choose what events your Discord channel receives by choosing the "Let me select individual events" option and selecting individual events for the new webhook you're configuring. The supported [events](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads) are `commit_comment`, `create`, `delete`, `fork`, `issue_comment`, `issues`, `member`, `public`, `pull_request`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `push`, `release`, `watch`, `check_run`, `check_suite`, `discussion`, and `discussion_comment`.

## Edit Webhook Message
<Route method="PATCH">/webhooks/[\{webhook.id\}](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#webhook-object)/[\{webhook.token\}](/developers/docs/resources/webhook#webhook-object)/messages/[\{message.id\}](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-object)</Route>

Edits a previously-sent webhook message from the same token. Returns a [message](/developers/docs/resources/message#message-object) object on success.

When the `content` field is edited, the arrays `mentions` and `mention_roles` and the boolean `mention_everyone` in the message object will be reconstructed from scratch based on the new content. When the message flag `IS_COMPONENTS_V2` is set, the reconstructed arrays and boolean are based on the edited content in the `components` array. The `allowed_mentions` field of the edit request controls how this happens. If there is no explicit `allowed_mentions` in the edit request, the content will be parsed with _default_ allowances, that is, without regard to whether or not an `allowed_mentions` was present in the request that originally created the message.

Refer to [Uploading Files](/developers/docs/reference#uploading-files) for details on attachments and `multipart/form-data` requests.
Any provided files will be **appended** to the message. To remove or replace files you will have to supply the `attachments` field which specifies the files to retain on the message after edit.

<Warning>
Starting with API v10, the `attachments` array must contain all attachments that should be present after edit, including **retained and new** attachments provided in the request body.
</Warning>

<Info>
All parameters to this endpoint are optional and nullable.

\* The `SUPPRESS_EMBEDS` flag can be both set and unset, while the `IS_COMPONENTS_V2` flag can only be set. When the `IS_COMPONENTS_V2` flag is set, any of the used `content`, `embeds`, `files[n]` or `poll` values in the initial message must be set to `null` first, otherwise it will fail with a 400 BAD REQUEST response.

\*\* Application-owned webhooks can always send components. Non-application-owned webhooks cannot send interactive components, and the `components` field will be ignored unless they set the `with_components` query param.

\*\*\* See [Uploading Files](/developers/docs/reference#uploading-files) for details.

\*\*\*\* Polls can only be added when editing a deferred interaction response.
