# Discord Official API Documentation

This repo contains the official Discord API documentation, which can be viewed online [HERE](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). Before submitting pull-requests, please remember to _fully_ read the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

This repository reflects the Discord API as it is meant to be accessed by third-party applications. It omits features and capabilities that are not generally available, or are not fully supported for third-party usage.

We welcome your contributions!

## Markdown Syntax

This repository uses special markdown syntax that helps style the resulting web version of the documentation.

### H6 Headings

H6 headings should be used above tables and code blocks to properly label them.

### Linking

Links between docs can be achieved by using a hash symbol (#), plus the markdown file name, plus a slash, and finally the dash-separated anchor. For instance, to link to the above H6 heading section:

```md
[Links to README.md H6](#README/h6-headings)
```

### Alert Boxes

Alert boxes are achieved by using a block quote that has one of 'warn', 'danger' or 'info' on the first line.

## Need some help?

Here are some Discord servers that can help you out with everything Discord API:

The [Official Discord Developers server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers) has plenty of help channels with knowledgeable people and Discord's developers to get you help with something you need, and get updates straight from the developers. However do keep in mind this is a purely on-topic server. If you are looking for a community, join the server below.

The [Unofficial Discord API server](https://discord.gg/discord-api) is a common hangout for library and bot developers alike. It's a great starting point for those looking to dive in and learn bot-creation with the Discord API.
