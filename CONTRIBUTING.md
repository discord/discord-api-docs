## Markdown Syntax

This repository uses special markdown syntax that helps style the resulting web version of the documentation.

### H6 Headings

H6 headings should be used above tables and code blocks to properly label them.

### Linking

Links between docs can be achieved by using a hash symbol (#), plus the markdown file name, plus a slash, and finally the dash-separated anchor. For instance, to link to the above H6 heading section:

```md
[Links to README.md H6](#README/h6-headings)
```

### Alert Boxes

Alert boxes are created using a block quote that has one of 'warn', 'danger', 'info', or 'preview' on the first line. 
For example:
```
> warn
> Something that requires warning here
```

### MDX Components

There are a few reusable MDX components that can be used on pages with the `mdx` extension. 

#### Collapsibles

Collapsibles allow you to show/hide content on a page that may be secondary to the page's primary content. They have four fields that can be set: `title`, `description`, `icon`, and an `open` flag (which makes the collapsible element open by default).

Available options for `icon`:
- `"list"`
- `"view"`
- `"question"`
- `"code"`
- `"warning"`

###### Example

![Collapsible MDX Component with the list icon](images/mdx-collapsible.png)

```markdown
<Collapsible title="Title" description="Description text" icon="list">
Collapsed content
</Collapsible>
```

#### Buttons

Buttons are simply... clickable buttons. They take `href` and `color` as arguments, but currently we only use `"brand"` as a value for `color`.

###### Example

![Button MDX Component](images/mdx-button.png)

```markdown
<LinkButton to="https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started" color="brand">click the button!</LinkButton>
```

#### Cards

Cards let you display links in a card format. They accept two arguments, `title` and `link`.

###### Example

![Card MDX Component](images/mdx-card.png)

```markdown
<Card title="Card Title" link="https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started">
This is the content inside of the card~
</Card>
```
