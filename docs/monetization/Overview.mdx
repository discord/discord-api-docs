### Offer native payment and checkout in your app using our Monetization APIs.
Premium Apps lets you prompt customers to start subscripions or purchase one-time items with our easy-to-use checkout and payment process. Discord notifies your app of the user's purchase, allowing you to grant access to your premium features.

- Sell monthly recurring [subscriptions](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_IMPLEMENTING_APP_SUBSCRIPTIONS) for your app's premium functionality within Discord
- Sell [one-time purchases](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_IMPLEMENTING_ONE-TIME_PURCHASES) for both durable and consumable items or functionality within your app
- Highlight your app's premium benefits on the App Directory and on your own [Store](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_MANAGING_YOUR_STORE) page
- Offer native product tie-ins and upsells on the App Directory, app profiles, and in chat
- With secure transactions & fraud detection, your customers can securely pay for purchases without leaving Discord

## Components of a Premium App
To integrate a premium feature into your application, there are three primary components of our Monetization API:

- [SKUs](#DOCS_RESOURCES_SKU) represent specific items or subscription options your app offers. Each SKU is a unique offering.
- [Entitlements](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT) indicate whether a user has access to a specific premium offering or SKU.
- [Subscriptions](#DOCS_RESOURCES_SUBSCRIPTION) represent an ongoing agreement where a user commits to paying for an entitlement on a recurring basis until cancelled.

### Types of SKUs
There are two types of SKUs that you can create for your app:

#### One-Time Purchase SKUs
A one-time purchase SKU represents a single item or feature that a user can purchase once. Developers can offer two types of one-time purchases:
- Durable items: Items that a user can purchase once and keep forever. For example, a user might purchase a "premium" upgrade that unlocks premium features in an app.
- Consumable items: Items that a user can purchase once and use up. For example, a user might purchase a "boost" item that gives them a temporary boost in an app.

#### Subscription SKUs
A subscription SKU represents a recurring purchase that a user can subscribe to for a set period of time. Developers can offer two types of subscriptions:

- User subscriptions: A user subscribes to a SKU for themselves. In this case, only the purchasing user is considered entitled to the SKU.
- Guild subscriptions: A user subscribes to a SKU for their guild. All members of that guild are considered entitled to the SKU.
