# Implementing App Subscriptions

Charge users for premium app functionality with a recurring user or guild subscription.

- Before you can add an app subscription to your app, you must [Enable Monetization](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_ENABLING_MONETIZATION) for your app.
- Once you've confirmed eligibility for your app and team, you will be able to set up a [SKU](#DOCS_RESOURCES_SKU) (stock-keeping unit) to represent your subscription.

---

## Types of Subscriptions

When creating subscriptions, you will need to choose between user or guild subscriptions:

- **User Subscriptions**: Offers premium features to an individual user across any server where your app installed.
- **Guild Subscriptions**: Provides premium benefits to all members within a specific server.

## How App Subscriptions Work

> **Starting on October 1st, 2024**, the`ENTITLEMENT_CREATE` and `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event behavior described below is changing. Please see the [Change Log and Entitlement Migration Guide](#DOCS_CHANGE_LOG/subscription-api-and-entitlement-migration) for more information on what is changing and how to prepare.

- When a user purchases your subscription SKU, Discord creates an [Entitlement](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT) for the user (or guild) and that specific Subscription [SKU](#DOCS_RESOURCES_SKU). 
- You will receive an `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE` event via the Gateway.
- This entitlement will be available via the `LIST Entitlements` API endpoint.
- This entitlement will be available on `Interaction Payloads` initiated from the entitled user or users in a guild (for guild subscriptions).
- This subscription will be available via the `LIST Subscriptions` API endpoint.
- This entitlement is granted and updated with a new `ends_at` date for each succesful billing interval until the user decides to cancel their subscription.
- When a user cancels their subscription, you will **not** receive an `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` with a new `ends_at` value, the entitlement will just expire at the current `ends_at` value.

### Using Subscription Events for the Subscription Lifecycle

Because entitlements are granted indefinitely and don't update on renewal or cancellation, you can use subscription events to track the lifecycle of a subscription.

> info
> This is not a complete list of when events may occur. You should use the presence of an entitlement to determine if a user has access to your premium features. The Subscription API and related events are intended for reporting and lifecycle management purposes and **should not be used as the source of truth of whether a user has access to your premium features**.

| Event Name            | Subscription Behavior                      | Updated Fields                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SUBSCRIPTION_CREATE` | Subscription is created                    | `status` is either `0 (active)` if an entitlement has been granted or `1 (ending)` if an entitlement has not yet been granted |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE` | Subscription is granted an entitlement     | `status` is `0 (active)`                                                                                                      |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE` | Subscription is renewed                    | `current_period_start`, `current_period_end` timestamps updated                                                               |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE` | Subscription is canceled                   | `canceled_at` timestamp updated,  `status` is `1 (ending)`                                                                    |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE` | Subscription ends                          | `status` is `2 (inactive)`, this event is processed asynchronously and will not be immediate                                  |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE` | Subscription is resumed/uncanceled by user | `status` is `0 (active)`                                                                                                      |

## Working with Entitlements

When a user purchases a subscription, an entitlement is created. [Entitlements](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT) represent the user's access to your consumable or durable item.

Depending on your app's features, you can use a combination of [Gateway events](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/entitlements), the [Entitlement HTTP API](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT), and [interaction payloads](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING) to keep track of user and guild entitlements and grant perks to users who have subscribed to your app.

### Accessing Entitlements with Gateway Events

> danger
> **Starting on October 1, 2024**, the `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE` and `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event behavior described below is changing. Please see the [Change Log and Entitlement Migration Guide](#DOCS_CHANGE_LOG/subscription-api-and-entitlement-migration) for more information on what is changing and how to prepare. The docs will be updated on November 1, 2024 to reflect the new behavior.

When users subscribe or renew a subscription with your app, Discord will emit [Entitlement Gateway events](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/entitlements).

For subscription SKUs, you will receive the following entitlement events:

| Event                | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE` | When a user is granted an entitlement to your app's subscription SKU                                                                                               |
| `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` | When a subscription is resumed, renewed, or canceled                                                                                                               |
| `ENTITLEMENT_DELETE` | When Discord refunds a subscription, removes an entitlement, or when a developer [deletes a Test Entitlement](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/delete-test-entitlement) |

### Accessing Entitlements with the HTTP API

For apps requiring background processing or not solely reliant on interactions, keeping track of entitlements is essential. You can utilize the [List Entitlements](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/list-entitlements) endpoint to list active and expired entitlements. Your app can filter entitlements by a specific user or guild by using the `?user_id=XYZ` or `?guild_id=XYZ` query params.

For example, you might keep track of our entitlements in a database and check if a user still has access to a specific SKU before performing a cron job or other task.

### Accessing Entitlements on Interaction Payloads

Entitlements are also available on the `Interaction Payload` when a user interacts with your app. You can find the entitlements on the `entitlements` field of the `Interaction Payload` when [receiving and responding to interactions](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING). You can use this field to determine if the user or guild is subscribed to your app. 

### Accessing Entitlements with the Embedded App SDK

When using the [Embedded App SDK](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK) to build an [Activity](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW), you can also [access a user's entitlements](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/getentitlements). Check out the [Implementing In-App Purchases for Activities](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_IMPLEMENTING_IAP_FOR_ACTIVITIES) guide to learn more about monetization with the Embedded App SDK.

## Prompting Users to Subscribe

### Responding with a Premium Button

[Responding with a premium button](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_MANAGING_SKUS/responding-with-a-premium-button) gives you the ability to prompt users to subscribe to your app when they attempt to use a premium feature without a subscription.

You can do this by sending a message with a [button](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/buttons) with a [premium style](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/button-object-button-styles) and a `sku_id` that allows the user to upgrade to your premium offering. 

### Starting a Purchase from an Activity

If you are using the [Embedded App SDK](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK) to build an [Activity](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW), you can also launch the purchase flow for a specific SKU using the SDK. Check out the [Implementing In-App Purchases for Activities](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_IMPLEMENTING_IAP_FOR_ACTIVITIES) guide to learn more about monetization with the Embedded App SDK.

## Using the Subscription API

> info 
> When implementing monetization, [Entitlements](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT) should be considered the source of truth for a user's access to a specific SKU. The Subscription API is intended for reporting and lifecycle management purposes that happen outside the flow of a user's interaction with your app.

You can use the [Subscription API](#DOCS_RESOURCES_SUBSCRIPTION) to check on the status of your app subscriptions. This API allows you to list all subscriptions for your app for reporting purposes and to check on the status of subscriptions without having to access entitlements directly.

- [List SKU Subscriptions](#DOCS_RESOURCES_SUBSCRIPTION/list-sku-subscriptions): List all subscriptions for a specific SKU in your app.
- [Get SKU Subscription](#DOCS_RESOURCES_SUBSCRIPTION/get-sku-subscription): Get a specific subscription in your app.
- [Subscription Gateway events](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/subscriptions): Discord will emit gateway events when a subscription is created, updated, and very rarely, deleted.

## Testing Your App Subscription Implementation

### Using Test Entitlements

You can test your implementation by [creating](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/create-test-entitlement) and [deleting](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/delete-test-entitlement) test entitlements. These entitlements will allow you to test your premium offering in both a subscribed and unsubscribed state as a user or guild. 

This method will not let you test out the full payment flow in Discord but will allow you to test your app's behavior when a user is subscribed or unsubscribed. See [Using Live Entitlements](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_IMPLEMENTING_APP_SUBSCRIPTIONS/using-live-entitlements) if you'd like to see the full payment flow.

> info
> Test Entitlements do not have a `starts_at` or `ends_at` field as they are valid until they are deleted.

### Using Live Entitlements

If you'd like to test the full payment flow for your app, you can do so by interacting with your Store page or a [premium styled button](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_IMPLEMENTING_APP_SUBSCRIPTIONS/prompting-users-to-subscribe). Any team members associated with your app will automatically see a 100% discount on the price of the subscription, allowing you to purchase without the use of live payment method. 

After checkout, you will have a live subscription that includes a `starts_at` and `ends_at` value. If you cancel this subscription, it will remain an active entitlement until the `ends_at` timestamp. This subscription will renew until canceled and can be used in testing subscription renewals in your app.

> info
> You can only delete entitlements created using the [create entitlement](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/create-test-entitlement) endpoint. If you need to toggle access to your premium features during your development process, it is best to use Test Entitlements.
