### Offer native payment and checkout in your app using our Monetization APIs.

Premium Apps lets you prompt customers to start subscriptions or purchase one-time items with our easy-to-use checkout and payment process. Discord notifies your app of the user's purchase, allowing you to grant access to your premium features.

- Sell monthly recurring [subscriptions](/docs/monetization/implementing-app-subscriptions) for your app's premium functionality within Discord
- Sell [one-time purchases](/docs/monetization/implementing-one-time-purchases) for both durable and consumable items or functionality within your app
- Highlight your app's premium benefits on the App Directory and on your own [Store](/docs/monetization/managing-skus#viewing-your-store-page) page
- Offer native product tie-ins and upsells on the App Directory, app profiles, and in-chat
- With secure transactions & fraud detection, your customers can securely pay for purchases without leaving Discord

## Components of a Premium App

To integrate a premium feature into your application, there are three primary components of our Monetization API:

- [SKUs](/docs/resources/sku) represent specific items or subscription options your app offers. Each SKU is a unique offering.
- [Entitlements](/docs/resources/entitlement) indicate whether a user has access to a specific premium offering or SKU.
- [Subscriptions](/docs/resources/subscription) represent an ongoing agreement where a user commits to paying for an entitlement on a recurring basis until canceled.

### Types of SKUs

There are two types of SKUs that you can create for your app:

#### One-Time Purchase SKUs

A one-time purchase SKU represents a single item or feature that a user can purchase once. Developers can offer two types of one-time purchases:
- Durable items: Items that a user can purchase once and keep forever. For example, a user might purchase a "premium" upgrade that unlocks premium features in an app.
- Consumable items: Items that a user can purchase once and use up. For example, a user might purchase a "boost" item that gives them a temporary boost in an app.

#### Subscription SKUs

A subscription SKU represents a recurring purchase that a user can subscribe to for a set period of time. Developers can offer two types of subscriptions:

- User subscriptions: A user subscribes to a SKU for themselves. In this case, only the purchasing user is considered entitled to the SKU.
- Guild subscriptions: A user subscribes to a SKU for their guild. All members of that guild are considered entitled to the SKU.
