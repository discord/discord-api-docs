# Overview of Discord Apps

![Overview of Apps](overview-of-apps-banner.png)

Discord apps customize, extend, and enhance Discord for millions of users. Whether you're a developer interested in building an Activity, customizing servers, or integrating a game, apps are the container to bring your idea to life.

On this page we'll answer the questions:

- [Where are apps installed?](#DOCS_QUICK_START_OVERVIEW_OF_APPS/where-are-apps-installed)

## What can apps do?

You will discover the full possibility of apps as you explore the documentation and start building, but for now let's take a glance at some features you can build and integrate as you're developing your app.

### Send and manage messages

Messages are a core part of Discord, and that's true for apps too. Apps can send messages in a few ways—they can call the **[Create Message endpoint](#DOCS_RESOURCES_MESSAGE/create-message)**, create and execute [webhooks](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK), or respond with a message when responding to an [interaction](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_OVERVIEW). Apps can also manage messages if they have the proper permissions, which is covered more in the [Message documentation](#DOCS_RESOURCES_MESSAGE).

### Interact with users

Apps can use **[interactions](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_OVERVIEW)** to create more engaging and intuitive experiences for users. When sending messages, apps can send interactive components like [buttons](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/buttons) and [select menus](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/select-menus) in the `components` field. Apps can also open form-like modals or launch an Activity [in response to interactions](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-response-object-modal).

### Build embedded games and experiences

Using the [Embedded App SDK](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK), apps can create **[Activities](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW)** which are cross-platform interactive games and social experiences in Discord. They run in iframes in Discord, where people who play games are already hanging out.

### Customize servers

With the right API endpoints and proper [permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS), apps can customize the experience of using and moderating servers by accessing and customizing all sorts of resources core to Discord—including [users](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER), [channels](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL), and [AutoMod](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUTO_MODERATION) to name a few. Explore the **Resources** documentation category to learn about the different Discord resources and how apps can use them.

### Update user metadata and presence

Apps can update a Discord's user metadata with data from a party game or app in a few ways.Apps can also update a user's profile with actionable data from a game or app by integrating **[Rich Presence](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_OVERVIEW)**. Apps can also use **[role connection metadata](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION_ROLE_CONNECTION_METADATA)** to associate third-party metadata (like stats or account type) with Discord users, which server admins can use to set up roles based on. You can explore more in the [configuring metadata for linked roles](#DOCS_TUTORIALS_CONFIGURING_APP_METADATA_FOR_LINKED_ROLES) tutorial.

### Add premium features

**[App subscriptions](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_IMPLEMENTING_APP_SUBSCRIPTIONS)** let apps charge users and/or servers for premium functionality on a recurring basis natively within Discord. You can read more about eligibility and adding monetization features to your app in the [Monetization](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_OVERVIEW) documentation.

### ...and more

This developer documentation is full of nooks and crannies with all sorts of features to explore. Discover the possibilities by exploring more of the docs, or by [building your own app](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## Where are apps installed?

Discord apps can be installed in two different contexts:

1. Apps installed **to a server** (called a [guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD) throughout the API) by a user with the Manage Server ([`MANAGE_GUILD`](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions-bitwise-permission-flags)) permission. Apps installed to a server can only be used within that server and DMs with the app's bot user, and are visible to all server members.
2. Apps installed **to a user account**. Apps installed to a user are visible *only* to that user, across all of their servers, DMs, and Group DMs by default.

The installation contexts that an app supports can be limited by the developer when [setting up the app](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/setting-supported-installation-contexts). Details about installation contexts are in the [Application resource documentation](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/installation-context).

## What APIs can apps use?

There are a handful of different APIs that you can pick and choose from based on your app's functionality and which Discord features you want to access. Below is a quick overview of the main APIs on the Discord developer platform, but you can read more details and information about API usage in the [API reference](#DOCS_REFERENCE).

### HTTP API

The **HTTP API** is a REST API that lets you interact and modify core Discord resources like [channels](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL), [servers (or guilds)](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD), [users](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER), and [messages](#DOCS_RESOURCES_MESSAGE/message-object).

Use the HTTP API to:
- Retrieve information about a resource
- Create, update, or delete a resource

Read details about using the HTTP API in the [API reference](#DOCS_REFERENCE/http-api).

### Gateway API

The **Gateway API** lets you receive event data over a WebSocket anytime an [event](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS) occurs in a server where your app is installed.

Use the Gateway API to:
- Receive events happening in Discord

Read details about using the Gateway API in the [API reference](#DOCS_REFERENCE/gateway-websocket-api).
