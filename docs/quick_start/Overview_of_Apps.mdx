# Overview of Discord Apps

![Overview of Apps](overview-of-apps-banner.png)

Discord apps customize, extend, and enhance Discord for millions of users. Whether you're a developer interested in building an Activity, customizing servers, or integrating a game, apps provide the container to bring your idea to life.

In this page, we will answer the following questions:

- [What can apps do?](#DOCS_QUICK_START_OVERVIEW_OF_APPS/what-can-apps-do)
- [Where are apps installed?](#DOCS_QUICK_START_OVERVIEW_OF_APPS/where-are-apps-installed)

## What Can Apps Do?

You will discover the full potential of apps as you explore the documentation and start building, but for now, let’s take a glance at some features you can build and integrate into your app.

### Send and Manage Messages

Messages are a core aspect of Discord, and the same holds true for apps. Apps can send messages in several ways—by calling the **[Create Message endpoint](#DOCS_RESOURCES_MESSAGE/create-message)**, by creating and executing [webhooks](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK), or by replying with a message in response to an [interaction](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_OVERVIEW). Apps can also manage messages if they have the proper permissions, as detailed in the [Messages documentation](#DOCS_RESOURCES_MESSAGE).

### Interact with Users

Apps can use **[interactions](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_OVERVIEW)** to create more engaging and intuitive experiences for users. When sending messages, apps can include interactive components like [buttons](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/buttons) and [select menus](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS/select-menus) in the `components` field. They can also open modal forms or launch an Activity [in response to interactions](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-response-object-modal).

### Build Embedded Games and Experiences

Using the [Embedded App SDK](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK), apps can create **[Activities](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW)**—interactive games and social experiences that work across platforms within Discord. These run in iframes inside Discord, where the community is already active.

### Customize Servers

With the proper API endpoints and permissions, apps can enhance and personalize the experience of using and moderating servers by accessing and customizing various core Discord resources, including [users](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER), [channels](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL), and [AutoMod](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUTO_MODERATION), among others. Check out the **Resources** section of the documentation to learn more about the different Discord resources and how apps can interact with them.

### Update User Metadata and Presence

Apps can update a Discord user’s metadata with data from a game or app. They can also enhance a user’s profile with actionable information via **[Rich Presence](#DOCS_RICH_PRESENCE_OVERVIEW)**. Additionally, apps can use **[role connection metadata](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION_ROLE_CONNECTION_METADATA)** to associate third-party metadata (like stats or account type) with Discord users, enabling server admins to set up roles based on this information. For more details, see the tutorial on [Configuring Metadata for Linked Roles](#DOCS_TUTORIALS_CONFIGURING_APP_METADATA_FOR_LINKED_ROLES).

### Add Premium Features

**[App subscriptions](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_IMPLEMENTING_APP_SUBSCRIPTIONS)** allow apps to charge users and/or servers for premium features on a recurring basis directly within Discord. Read more about eligibility and implementing monetization features in the [Monetization documentation](#DOCS_MONETIZATION_OVERVIEW).

## Where Are Apps Installed?

Discord apps can be installed in two different contexts:

1. **Server Installation:** Also referred to as a [guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD) in the API, this installation is performed by a user with the Manage Server ([`MANAGE_GUILD`](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions-bitwise-permission-flags)) permission. Apps installed on a server can only be used within that server and in direct messages (DMs) with the app’s bot user, and they are visible to all server members.
2. **User Account Installation:** Apps installed on a user account are visible *only* to that user across all their servers, DMs, and group DMs by default.

Developers can limit the supported installation contexts for an app when [setting it up](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/setting-supported-installation-contexts). For additional details, refer to the [Application resource documentation](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/installation-context).

## Which APIs Can Apps Use?

Depending on your app’s functionality and the Discord features you want to access, you can choose from several APIs. Below is an overview of the main APIs on the Discord developer platform. For more details, see the [API reference](#DOCS_REFERENCE).

### HTTP API

The **HTTP API** is a RESTful API that allows you to interact with and modify core Discord resources like [channels](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL), [servers (guilds)](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD), [users](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER), and [messages](#DOCS_RESOURCES_MESSAGE/message-object).

Use the HTTP API to:
- Retrieve information about a resource
- Create, update, or delete a resource

Learn more about using the HTTP API in the [API reference](#DOCS_REFERENCE/http-api).

### Gateway API

The **Gateway API** allows you to receive event data over a WebSocket whenever an [event](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY_EVENTS) occurs in a server where your app is installed.

Use the Gateway API to:
- Receive notifications of events occurring on Discord

See additional details on the Gateway API in the [API reference](#DOCS_REFERENCE/gateway-websocket-api).
