# Webhook Events

Webhook events are one-way events sent to your app over HTTP to notify you when an event occured. Unlike events that are [sent over Gateway connections](/docs/events/gateway), events sent over webhooks are not realtime or guaranteed to be in order.

While [incoming webhooks](/docs/resources/webhook) are triggered by an external service, webhook events (i.e. outgoing webhooks) are triggered by events happening in Discord. This means your app will need to set up a public URL where you can receive HTTP events, which is detailed in the [preparing for events](/docs/events/webhook-events#preparing-for-events) section.

## Subscribing to Events

To configure webhook events, you'll need to configure your URL and select the events you want your app to receive.

:::info
The steps below walk through subscribing using the developer portal. If you prefer to use the API, you can call [Edit Current Application](/docs/resources/application#edit-current-application).
:::

In your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications), navigate to the **Webhooks** page from the left-hand sidebar then complete the following:

1. Under **Endpoint**, add a public URL that is set up to receive and acknowledge webhook events. Details about setting up a Webhook Events URL is in the [preparing for events](/docs/events/webhook-events#preparing-for-events) section.
2. Enable Events by clicking the toggle in the **Events** section.
3. Select the [webhook events](/docs/events/webhook-events#event-types) you want your app to receive.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

If your URL is successfully verified, your app should begin receiving the events you selected.

## Preparing for Events

To receive webhook events, you'll need to configure your app's **Webhook Event URL** in your app's settings.

### Configuring a Webhook Events URL

A **Webhook Events URL** is a public endpoint for your app where Discord can send your app HTTP-based events. If your app is using [Gateway events](/docs/events/gateway), you don't need to configure a Webhook Events URL.

#### Setting Up an Endpoint

Before you can add a Webhook Events URL to your app, your endpoint must be prepared for two things ahead of time:

1. Acknowledging `PING` events from Discord
2. Validate security-related request headers (`X-Signature-Ed25519` and `X-Signature-Timestamp`)

If either of these are not complete, your Webhook Events URL will not be validated. Details on acknowledging PING events and validating security-related headers are below.

###### Acknowledging PING requests

When adding your Webhook Events URL, Discord will send a `POST` request with a `PING` payload with a `type: 0` to your endpoint. Your app is expected to acknowledge the request by returning a `204` response with an empty body.

:::info
You must provide a valid `Content-Type` when responding to `PING`s. See [here](/docs/reference#http-api) for further information.
:::

<Collapsible title="Responding to PING Requests" description="Code example for acknowledging PING events" icon="code">
To properly acknowledge a `PING` payload, return a `204` response with no body:

```py
@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def my_command():
    if request.json["type"] == 0:
        return Response(status=204)
```
</Collapsible> 

###### Validating Security Request Headers

To receive events via HTTP, there are some security steps you **must** take before your app is eligible to receive requests.

Each webhook is sent with the following headers:

-   `X-Signature-Ed25519` as a signature
-   `X-Signature-Timestamp` as a timestamp

Using your favorite security library, you **must validate the request each time you receive an event**. If the signature fails validation, your app should respond with a `401` error code. Code examples of validating security headers is in the [Interactions documentation](/docs/interactions/overview#setting-up-an-endpoint-validating-security-request-headers).

In addition to ensuring your app validates security-related request headers at the time of saving your endpoint, Discord will also perform automated, routine security checks against your endpoint, including purposefully sending you invalid signatures. If you fail the validation, we will remove your Webhook Events URL and alert you via email and System DM.

We recommend checking out our [Community Resources](/docs/developer-tools/community-resources) and the libraries found there.

#### Adding an Webhook Events Endpoint URL

After you have a public endpoint to use as your app's Event Webhooks URL, you can add it to your app by going to your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

On the **Webhooks** page, look for the **Endpoint URL** field. Paste your public URL that is set up to acknowledge `PING` messages and correctly handles security-related signature headers.

After you configure your Webhook Events URL, you can [enable and subscribe to events](/docs/events/webhook-events#subscribing-to-events) on the same page.


## Responding to Events

When your Webhook Event URL receives a webhook event, your app should respond with a `204` status code with no body **within 3 seconds** to acknowledge that your app successfully received it. If your app doesn't respond to the webhook event, Discord will retry sending it several times using exponential backoff for up to 10 minutes.

If your app fails to respond too often, Discord will stop sending you webhook events and notify you via email.

## Webhook Event Payloads

Webhook events are wrapped in an outer payload, with an inner `event` object.

## Social SDK Message Objects

Discord Social SDK utilizes specialized message objects for lobby and direct message events that occur during active game sessions. These objects extend or modify the standard Discord message structure to support communication features.

- [Lobby messages](/docs/events/webhook-events#lobby-message-object) include lobby-specific fields like `lobby_id`
- [Standard Discord messages](/docs/events/webhook-events#message-object) in SDK contexts may include additional fields
- [Passthrough messages](/docs/events/webhook-events#passthrough-message-object) are used for communication between provisional accounts

These objects are used in the webhook events `LOBBY_MESSAGE_*` and `GAME_DIRECT_MESSAGE_*` depending on the messaging context.

### Lobby Message Object

Represents a message sent in a lobby or [Linked Channel](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/linked-channels).

When both users in a direct message are provisional accounts, messages become "passthrough messages" that are only visible in-game and use this specialized structure.
