# Local Development

## Run Your Application Locally

It is possible to load your application via a localhost port or other unique URL. This URL must support an HTTPS connection to load on the web/desktop Discord app (HTTPS is not required for mobile). The downside to this flow is that your application's network traffic will not pass through Discord's proxy, which means any requests made by the application will need to use a full URL instead of a ["mapped"](/docs/activities/development-guides/local-development#url-mapping) URL.

To run your locally hosted application, follow the instructions for [Launching your Application from the Discord Client](/docs/activities/development-guides/local-development#launch-your-application-from-the-discord-client) and set the Application URL Override to the address of your application's web server.

### Running Your Application Through A Network Tunnel

Although it is possible to test your application locally, we recommend developing and testing against the Discord proxy. This is helpful to make sure all URLs behave as expected before your application runs in production. One technique to enable testing locally against the proxy is to use a network tunneling tool, such as [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared#installing-cloudflared). A typical pattern is for each developer to have their own "development-only" application. To set up a local environment to run through Discord's proxy, you will need to do the following:

1. Create a new application in the Discord Developer portal.
2. Enable Activities for your app.
3. Set up the application's [URL mapping](/docs/activities/development-guides/local-development#url-mapping).
4. Locally, spin up your web server.
5. Install and run a tunnel solution, such as [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared#installing-cloudflared). You will point it to your local web server.

:::info
Your web server can be HTTP and your network tunnel can upgrade the connection to HTTPS.
:::

If using cloudflared, you will run the following command, replace `3000` with your web server's port.

```
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

Once you run this command, you will receive your publicly accessible network tunnel address from cloudflared.

```
Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at (it may take some time to be reachable):
https://funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com
```

In the Discord Developer Portal, update the Application URL mapping for `/` url to `funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com` to match your network tunnel address and save your changes.

:::warn
If you do not own the URL that you are using to host the application (i.e. ngrok's free tier), someone else could claim that domain and host a malicious site in its place. Please be aware of these risks, and if you have to use a domain you do not own, be sure to reset your URL mapping when you are done using the tunnel.
:::

Follow the instructions for [Launching your Application from the Discord Client](/docs/activities/development-guides/local-development#launch-your-application-from-the-discord-client). Application URL Override should not be enabled.

### Running Your Application In Production

The flow for setting up your production application is very similar:

1. If not made yet, create a new application.
2. Enable Activities for your app.
3. Set up the application's [URL Mapping](/docs/activities/development-guides/local-development#url-mapping). The URL for your application's html should be set to the `/` route.
4. Follow the instructions for [Launching your Application from the Discord Client](/docs/activities/development-guides/local-development#launch-your-application-from-the-discord-client). Application URL Override should not be enabled.

This application now uses the same configuration it will use once it is fully published ✨.

### Launch your application from the Discord Client

You will be able to see and launch all activities owned by you or any teams you are a member of via the Developer Activity Shelf. One caveat is that the activity will not be shown on the current platform (web/ios/android) unless you have checked your platform in `Settings/Supported Platforms` on the developer portal.

To see you app inside of Discord in the Activity Shelf:

#### Web

1. Select ⚙️User Settings > App Settings > Advanced and toggle on `Developer Mode`
3. Close the settings window and enter a voice channel.
4. From either the RTC Panel or the Center Control Tray, click on the "Rocket Button" to open the Activity shelf. You should now see all of the same applications that you have access to in the developer portal. Note: The shelf will only include applications which have been flagged as "Embedded".
6. Click on an activity to launch it!

#### Mobile

1. From your User Profile, select Appearance, and then toggle "On" `Developer Mode`
2. Enter a voice channel
5. Click on an activity to launch it!

### URL Mapping

Activities in Discord are "sandboxed" via a Discord proxy. This is done to hide the users' IP addresses, your application's IP addresses, and to block URLs from known malicious endpoints. As an application owner, you can configure the proxy to allow network requests to external endpoints.

Because your application is "sandboxed", it will be unable to make network requests to external URLs. Let's say you want request `https://some-api.com`. To enable reaching this url from inside your application, you will create a new url mapping, with the `PREFIX` set to
`/api` and `TARGET` set to `some-api.com`. Now you can make requests to `/api` from inside of your application, which will be forwarded, via Discord's proxy to `some-api.com`.

#### How to set a URL Mapping

To add or modify your application's URL mappings, click on `Activities -> URL Mappings` and set the prefix and target values for each mapping as needed.

![Configuring your URL Mapping](images/activities/url-mapping-tutorial.png)

#### Prefix/Target formatting rules

- URL mappings can utilize any url protocol, (https, wss, ftp, etc...), which is why the URL target should not include a protocol. For example, for a URL target, do not put `https://your-url.com`, instead, omit `https://` and use `your-url.com`.
- Parameter matching can be used to help map external domain urls. For example, if an external url has many subdomains, such as `foo.google.com`, `bar.google.com`, then you could use the following mapping:
  | PREFIX                | TARGET                   |
  |-----------------------|--------------------------|
  | `/google/{subdomain}` | `{subdomain}.google.com` |
- Targets must point to a directory; setting a target to a file (e.g. `example.com/index.html`) is unsupported and may lead to unexpected behavior.
- Because of how URL globbing works, if you have multiple prefix urls with the same initial path, you must place the shortest of the prefix paths last in order for each url mapping to be reachable. For example, if you have `/foo` and `/foo/bar`, you must place the url `/foo/bar` before `/foo` or else the mapping for `/foo/bar` will never be reached.

|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requests mapped correctly                                   | Requests to /foo/bar will incorrectly be sent to `foo.com`      |

#### Exceptions

The aforementioned "sandbox" is enforced by a [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP). We have some notable exceptions to our CSP, meaning application clients may make requests to these URLs without hitting the proxy and therefore without establishing mappings. Notable exceptions include:

- `https://discord.com/api/`
- `https://canary.discord.com/api/`
- `https://ptb.discord.com/api/`
- `https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/`
- `https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/`
- `https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/`
- `https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/`
- `https://media.discordapp.net/avatars/`
- `https://media.discordapp.net/icons/`

### Logging

By default, the SDK will send any console `log`, `warn`, `error`, `info`, and `debug` events triggered by your app to the Discord application.

#### Viewing Logs on Desktop

Desktop logs are viewable through the console tab inside a browser's Developer Tools. See the [Troubleshooting Console Log Errors](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001239472-Troubleshooting-Console-Log-Errors) support article for more information.

The Public Test Build (PTB) Discord client also allows inspecting your logs from the `View -> Developer -> Toggle Developer Tools` menu.  It can be downloaded at [https://discord.com/downloads](https://discord.com/downloads).

#### Viewing Logs on Mobile

Mobile logs are viewable via the `Debug Logs` option inside User Settings on the mobile App. It is only discoverable when you have `Developer Mode` enabled.

1. On the bottom navigation, tap on your avatar and then the gear icon to open your `User Settings`.
2. Tap `Appearance`.
3. Slide the `Developer Mode` toggle to ON.
4. The `Debug Logs` option will be available under the `DEV ONLY` section.

#### Filtering for Application Logs

Inside the Debug Logs view, you can search for your own application logs with the possible keywords:

- `RpcApplicationLogger`
- Your Application ID

Each log line is formatted as: `[RpcApplicationLogger] <application-id> - message`

The first section of Debug Logs are not your application logs but Discord specific app startup info which is not relevant to your application.

When you scroll down the page, your application logs should be visible.

![debug-logs-filtering](images/activities/debug-logs-filtering.gif)

#### Sharing Application Logs from Mobile

With `Developer Mode` enabled, you can share your application logs from within a Voice Channel.

1. In the voice channel, swipe from the bottom to see the expanded voice controls. Tap on `Share Application Logs`.
2. You'll be presented with a native share sheet where you can save the logs to a file or share it as a message.

#### Disabling Logging

If you do not want logs to be forwarded to the browser, you can disable it with the optional configuration object.

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(clientId, {
  disableConsoleLogOverride: true,
});
```

#### Forwarding Log Messages

You can forward specific log messages via the SDK command `captureLog` as shown below.

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(clientId);
await discordSdk.ready();
discordSdk.commands.captureLog({
  level: 'log',
  message: 'This is my log message!',
});
```
