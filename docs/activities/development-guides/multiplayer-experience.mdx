# Multiplayer Experience

## Activity Instance Management

When a user clicks "Join Application", they expect to enter the same application that their friends are participating in. Whether the application is a shared drawing canvas, board game, collaborative playlist, or first-person shooter; the two users should have access to the same shared data. In this documentation, we refer to this shared data as an **application instance**.

![join-application](images/activities/join-application.png)

The Embedded App SDK allows your app to talk bidirectionally with the Discord Client. The `instanceId` is necessary for your application, as well as Discord, to understand which unique instance of an application it is talking to.

#### Using instanceId

The `instanceId` attribute is available as soon as the SDK is constructed, and does not require the SDK to receive a `ready` payload from the Discord client.

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(clientId);
// available immediately
const instanceId = discordSdk.instanceId;
```

The `instanceId` should be used as a key to save and load the shared data relevant to an application. This ensures that two users who are in the same application instance have access to the same shared data.

##### Semantics of instanceId

Instance IDs are generated when a user launches an application. Any users joining the same application will receive the same `instanceId`. When all the users of an application in a channel leave or close the application, that instance has finished its lifecycle, and will not be used again. The next time a user opens the application in that channel, a new `instanceId` will be generated.

## Instance Participants

Instance Participants are any Discord user actively connected to the same Application Instance. This data can be fetched or subscribed to.

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK, Events, type Types} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';

const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK('...');
await discordSdk.ready();

// Fetch
const participants = await discordSdk.commands.getInstanceConnectedParticipants();

// Subscribe
function updateParticipants(participants: Types.GetActivityInstanceConnectedParticipantsResponse) {
  // Do something really cool
}
discordSdk.subscribe(Events.ACTIVITY_INSTANCE_PARTICIPANTS_UPDATE, updateParticipants);
// Unsubscribe
discordSdk.unsubscribe(Events.ACTIVITY_INSTANCE_PARTICIPANTS_UPDATE, updateParticipants);
```

## Render Avatars and Names

Check out detailed documentation on where and how Discord stores common image assets [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#image-formatting-cdn-endpoints).

Here's a basic example for retrieving a user's avatar and username

```javascript
// We'll be referencing the user object returned from authenticate
const {user} = await discordSdk.commands.authenticate({
  access_token: accessToken,
});

let avatarSrc = '';
if (user.avatar) {
  avatarSrc = `https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/${user.id}/${user.avatar}.png?size=256`;
} else {
  const defaultAvatarIndex = (BigInt(user.id) >> 22n) % 6n;
  avatarSrc = `https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/${defaultAvatarIndex}.png`
}

const username = user.global_name ?? `${user.username}#${user.discriminator}`;

// Then in your HTML/JSX/etc...
<img alt="avatar" src={avatarSrc} />
<p>{username}</p>
```

#### Rendering guild-specific avatars and nicknames

In order to retrieve a user's guild-specific avatar and nickname, your application must request the `guilds.members.read` scope. Note, this only grants the information for that instance of the application's user. To display the guild-specific avater/nickname for all application users, any info retrieved from `guilds.members.read` scope'd API calls must be shared via your application's server.

Here's an example of how to retrieve the user's guild-specific avatar and nickname:

```javascript
// We'll be referencing the user object returned from authenticate
const {user} = await discordSdk.commands.authenticate({
  access_token: accessToken,
});

// When using the proxy, you may instead replace `https://discord.com` with `/discord`
// or whatever url mapping you have chosen via the developer portal
fetch(`https://discord.com/api/users/@me/guilds/${discordSdk.guildId}/member`, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
  },
})
  .then((response) => {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((guildsMembersRead) => {
    let guildAvatarSrc = '';
    // Retrieve the guild-specific avatar, and fallback to the user's avatar
    if (guildsMembersRead?.avatar) {
      guildAvatarSrc = `https://cdn.discordapp.com/guilds/${discordSdk.guildId}/users/${user.id}/avatars/${guildsMembersRead.avatar}.png?size=256`;
    } else if (user.avatar) {
      guildAvatarSrc = `https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/${user.id}/${user.avatar}.png?size=256`;
    } else {
      const defaultAvatarIndex = (BigInt(user.id) >> 22n) % 6n;
      avatarSrc = `https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/${defaultAvatarIndex}.png`;
    }

    // Retrieve the guild-specific nickname, and fallback to the username#discriminator
    const guildNickname = guildsMembersRead?.nick ?? (user.global_name ?? `${user.username}#${user.discriminator}`);
  });
```

This example is being done entirely on the client, however, a more common pattern is to instead, do the following:

- Store the user's access token on the application server
- Retrieve the user's guild-specific avatar and nickname via the application's server
- Serve all of the application's avatar/nicknames via the application's server

## Preventing unwanted activity sessions

Activities are surfaced through iframes in the Discord app. The activity website itself is publicly reachable at `<application_id>.discordsays.com`. Activities will expect to be able to communicate with Discord's web or mobile client via the Discord SDK's RPC protocol. If a user loads the activity's website in a normal browser, the Discord RPC server will not be present, and the activity will likely fail in some way.

It is theoretically possible for a malicious client to mock Discord's RPC protocol or load one activity website when launching another. Because the activity is loaded inside Discord, the RPC protocol is active, and the activity is none the wiser.

To enable an activity to "lock down" activity access, we encourage utilizing the `get_activity_instance` API, found at `discord.com/api/applications/<application_id>/activity-instances/<instance_id>'`. The route requires a Bot token of the application. It returns a serialized active activity instance for the given application, if found, otherwise it returns a 404. Here are two example responses:

```javascript
curl https://discord.com/api/applications/1215413995645968394/activity-instances/i-1234567890-gc-912952092627435520-912954213460484116 -H 'Authorization: Bot <bot token>'
{"message": "404: Not Found", "code": 0}

curl https://discord.com/api/applications/1215413995645968394/activity-instances/i-1276580072400224306-gc-912952092627435520-912954213460484116 -H 'Authorization: Bot <bot token>'
{"application_id":"1215413995645968394","instance_id":"i-1276580072400224306-gc-912952092627435520-912954213460484116","launch_id":"1276580072400224306","location":{"id":"gc-912952092627435520-912954213460484116","kind":"gc","channel_id":"912954213460484116","guild_id":"912952092627435520"},"users":["205519959982473217"]}
```

With this API, the activity's backend can verify that a client is in fact in an instance of that activity before allowing the client to participate in any meaningful gameplay. How an activity implements "session verification" is left to the developer's discretion. The solution can be as granular as gating specific features or as binary as not returning the activity HTML except for valid sessions.

In the below flow diagram, we show how the server can deliver the activity website, only for valid users in a valid activity instance:
