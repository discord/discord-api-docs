# Assets and Metadata

## Setting Up Activity Metadata

The Activity Shelf is where users can see what Activities can be played. It has various metadata and art assets that can be configured.

To update your app's metadata in the Discord Developer Portal, navigate to the `Settings -> General Information` tab of your app.

- **Application Name:** The publicly visible name of your app.
- **Application Icon:** The publicly visible icon for your app.
- **Application Description:** The application description is shown in the view of the Activity Shelf Item.
- **Max Participants:** The max participants indicate the maximum number of players for your application.
  - Max Participants is displayed above the name in the 1-up view: `Up to X participants`.
  - Leaving this field empty defaults to `Unlimited participants`.
  - Max Participants is also displayed under the name in the 2-up view.

:::info
An app can have a different application name and avatar from the application's bot username and avatar. Both sets of metadata are public-facing and may be visible in various situations when a user interacts with your app. You can view your bot's username on the `Settings -> Bot` tab.
