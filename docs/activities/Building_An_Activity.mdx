# Building Your First Activity in Discord

[Activities](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW) are web-based games and apps that can be run within Discord. Activities are embedded in iframes within the Discord client, and can be launched from the App Launcher or when responding to interactions.

If this is your first time learning about Activities, check out the [Activities Overview](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW) for more information and a collection of more advanced [sample projects](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW/sample-projects).

## Introduction

In this guide, we'll be building a Discord app with a basic Activity that handles user authentication and fetches data using the API.

It assumes an understanding of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) and [async functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function), and a basic understanding of frontend frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). If you are still learning to program, there are many free education resources to explore like [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development), and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming).

## Step 0: Enable Developer Mode

Before getting started, you need to enable Developer Mode for your Discord account if you don't already have it enabled. Developer Mode will allow you to run in-development Activities and expose resource IDs (like users, channels, and servers) in the client which can simplify testing. To enable Developer Mode:
1. Go to your **User Settings** in your Discord client. On Desktop, you can access **User Settings** by clicking on the cogwheel icon near the bottom-left, next to your username.
2. Click on **Advanced** tab from the left-hand sidebar and toggle on `Developer Mode`.

## Step 1: Setting up the project

Before creating an app, let's set up our project code from the [`discord/getting-started-activity`](https://github.com/discord/getting-started-activity) repository.

Open a terminal window and clone the project code:

```
git clone git@github.com:discord/getting-started-activity.git
```

The sample project you cloned is broken into two parts:
- `client` is the sample Activity's frontend, built with vanilla JavaScript and integrated with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to help with local development.
- `server` is a backend using vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, and Express. However, as you're building your own Activity, you can use whichever backend you prefer.

<Collapsible title="Project structure" description="Overview of the project structure for the sample app used in this guide" icon="code">

```
├── client
│   ├── main.js       -> your Activity frontend
│   ├── index.html

│   ├── vite.config.js
├── server
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── server.js     -> your Activity backend
└── .env              -> your credentials, IDs and secrets
```

</Collapsible>

### Install project dependencies

Before creating our Discord app, let's quickly install your project's frontend dependencies.

Navigate to your project folder's `client` directory, which is where all the sample Activity's frontend code lives:

```
cd getting-started-activity/client
```

Then install the project's dependencies and start up the frontend for the sample Activity:

```
# install project dependencies
npm install

# start frontend
npm run dev
```

If you visit http://localhost:5173/ you should see a vanilla JS frontend template running with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

While it's not much at the moment, in the following steps we'll connect it to the backend services, make it runnable in Discord, and power it up by populating it with data we pull from Discord APIs.

<Collapsible title="Step 1 Checkpoint" icon="list" open>

By the end of Step 1, you should have:
- An understanding of what Discord [Activities](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW) are
- Developer Mode enabled on your Discord account
- Cloned the [sample project](https://github.com/discord/getting-started-activity) to your development environment
- Installed the front-end dependencies (in the `client` folder)
</Collapsible>

---

## Step 2: Creating an app

With our project set up, let's create our app and configure the Activity. Create a new app in the developer portal if you don't have one already:

<Button href="https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true" color="brand">Create App</Button>

Enter a name for your app, select a development team, then press **Create**.

> info
> **Development Team Access** <br />Launching a non-distributed Activity is limited to you or members of the developer team, so if you're collaborating with others during development, create a [developer team](https://discord.com/developers/teams) and set it to the owner when you create the app.

After you create your app, you'll land on the **General Overview** page of the app's settings, where you can update basic information about your app like its description and icon.

### Choose installation contexts

Apps in Discord can be installed to different **[installation contexts](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/installation-context)**: servers, user accounts, or both.

The recommended *and* default behavior for apps is supporting both installation contexts, which lets the installer to choose the context during the installation flow. However, you can change the default behavior by changing the supported installation contexts in your app's settings.

<Collapsible title="Why do installation contexts matter?" description="Overview of where apps can be installed" icon="question">

As mentioned, installation contexts determine where your app can be installed. The installation context affect things like who can manage the installation, where the app's commands can appear, and the data returned in response to interactions.

- Apps installed in a **[server context](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/server-context)** (server-installed apps) must be authorized by a server member with the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission, and are visible to all members of the server.
- Apps installed in a **[user context](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/user-context)** (user-installed apps) are visible only to the authorizing user, and therefore don't require any server-specific permissions. Apps installed to a user context are visible across all of the user's servers, DMs, and GDMs—however, they're limited to using commands.

Details about installation contexts is in the [Application documentation](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/installation-context) and the [Developing a User-Installable App tutorial](#DOCS_TUTORIALS_DEVELOPING_A_USER_INSTALLABLE_APP).
</Collapsible>

Click on **Installation** in the left sidebar, then under **Installation Contexts** make sure both "User Install" and "Guild Install" are selected. This will make sure users can launch our app's Activity across Discord servers, DMs, and Group DMs.

### Enable Activities

Next, we'll need to enable Activities for your app. On the left hand sidebar under **Activities**, click **Getting Started**.

Review this page and press **Enable**.

![Enabling Activities in Settings](activities/getting-started-activities.png)

After enabling Activities, you'll see the different Activity-related pages in your app's settings under the **Activities** section. Across these pages, you'll be able to update information like supported platforms, upload assets, and configure Activity-specific settings. We'll come back to this section later in the guide to set up URL mappings.

#### Default Entry Point Command

When you enable Activities for your app, a [default Entry Point command](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/default-entry-point-command) called "Launch" is automatically created. This [Entry Point command](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/entry-point-commands) is the primary way for users to launch your Activity in Discord.

By default, interactions with this command will result in Discord opening your Activity for the user and posting a message in the channel where it was launched from. However, if you prefer to handle the interactions in your app, you can update the [`handler` field](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/entry-point-handlers) or create your own. Additional details are in the Entry Point command [documentation](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/entry-point-commands) and [development guide](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/setting-up-an-entry-point-command).

### Add a Redirect URI

Next, we'll add a Redirect URI, which is where a user is typically redirected to after authorizing with your app when going through the standard OAuth flow. While setting up a Redirect URI is required, the Embedded App SDK automatically handles redirecting users back to your Activity when the RPC [`authorize` command](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/authorize) is called.

You can learn more about the OAuth flow and redirect URIs in the [OAuth2 documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2), but since we're only authorizing in an Activity, we'll just use a placeholder value (`https://127.0.0.1`) and let the Embedded App SDK handle the rest.

Click on **OAuth2** on the sidebar in your app's settings. Under **Redirects**, enter `https://127.0.0.1` as a placeholder value then click **Save Changes**.

![Redirect URI in Activity Settings](activities/oauth2-redirect.png)

### Fetch Your OAuth2 Credentials

To use information related to a user (like their username) or a server (like the server's avatar), your app must be granted specific OAuth **scopes**.

For our sample app, we'll be requesting three scopes: `identify` to access basic information about a user, `guilds` to access basic information about the servers a user is in, and `applications.commands` to install [commands](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_OVERVIEW/commands). We'll request these later on in the guide, but a full list of scopes you can request is in the [OAuth2 documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes).

When requesting scopes later on, you'll need to pass your app's OAuth2 identifiers. For now, we'll copy these identifiers into your project's environment file.

In the root of your project, there is an `example.env` file. From the root of your project, run the following to copy it into a new `.env` file:

```
cp example.env .env
```

> warn
> **Secure Your Secrets**<br /> Your `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` are *highly* sensitive secrets. Never share either secrets or check them into any kind of version control.

Back in your app's settings, click on **OAuth2** on the sidebar:
1. **Client ID**: Copy the value for Client ID and add it to your `.env` file as **`VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`**. This is the public ID that Discord associates with your app, and is almost always the same as your App ID.
2. **Client Secret**: Copy the value for Client Secret and add it to your `.env` as **`DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`**. This is a private, sensitive identifier that your app will use to grant an OAuth2 `access_token`, and should never be shared or checked into version control.

> info
> **Why is there a VITE_ prefix before our Client ID?**<br />Prefixing the `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` environment variable with `VITE_` makes it accessible to our client-side code. This security measure ensures that only the variables you intend to be accessible in the browser are available, and all other environment variables remain private. You can read details in the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode).

<Collapsible title="Step 2 Checkpoint" icon="list" open>

By the end of Step 2, make sure you have:
- Created a Discord app with Activities enabled
- Set up a placeholder Redirect URI
- Added your app's Client ID and Client Secret to your project's `.env` file.
</Collapsible>

## Step 3: Setting Up the Embedded App SDK

With our project and app set up, we're going to install and configure the [Embedded App SDK](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK) which we'll use extensively through the rest of this guide.

The Embedded App SDK is a first-party SDK that handles the communication between Discord and your Activity with [commands](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/sdk-commands) to interact with the Discord client (like fetching information about the channel) and [events](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/sdk-events) to listen for user actions and changes in state (like when a user starts or stops speaking).

> info
> The events and commands available in the Embedded App SDK are a subset of the [RPC API](#DOCS_TOPICS_RPC) ones, so referencing the RPC documentation can be helpful to understand what's happening under the hood when developing Activities.

### Install the SDK

Back in our project's `client` directory from before (`getting-started-activity/client`), install the Embedded App SDK [via NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discord/embedded-app-sdk):

```
npm install @discord/embedded-app-sdk
```

This will add `@discord/embedded-app-sdk` to `getting-started-activity/client/package.json` and install the SDK in your `node_modules` folder.

### Import the SDK in your Project

Once installed, we need to import it into our client code and instantiate it to start the handshake between our app and the Discord client.

To instantiate the SDK, we will use the environment variables we set up in Step 2.

We also set up a check for the [`ready` event](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK/ready) with an async/await function which allows us to output a log or perform other actions once the handshake was successful.

<Collapsible title="Add SDK initialization to frontend" description="Code for adding the Embedded App SDK" icon="code" open>

In `getting-started-activity/client/main.js`, let's import and instantiate the SDK:

```js
// Import the SDK
import { DiscordSDK } from "@discord/embedded-app-sdk";

import "./style.css";
import rocketLogo from '/rocket.png';

// Instantiate the SDK
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID);

setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is ready");
});

async function setupDiscordSdk() {
  await discordSdk.ready();
}

document.querySelector('#app').innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <img src="${rocketLogo}" class="logo" alt="Discord" />
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </div>
`;
```

</Collapsible>

> warn
> **Time to leave your browser behind**<br />Once you add the SDK to your app, you will **not** be able to view your app inside your web browser. In the next step, we will run your Activity inside of Discord. In the next step, we will go over how to view you app in Discord.

<Collapsible title="Step 3 Checkpoint" icon="list" open>

By the end of Step 3, make sure you have:
- Installed the Embedded App SDK to your project
- Imported the SDK in your project's `client/main.js` file
</Collapsible>

## Step 4: Running your app in Discord

Let's ensure everything is wired up correctly, then run the Activity in Discord.

### Run your app

First, we'll restart the sample app. Open a terminal window and navigate to your project directory's `client` folder, then start the client-side app:

```
cd client
npm run dev
```

Your app should start and you should see output similar to the following:

```
VITE v5.0.12  ready in 100 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h + enter to show help
```

We'll use the Local URL as our publicly-accessible URL in the next step.

### Set up a public endpoint

Next, we'll need to set up the public endpoint that serves the Activity's frontend. To do that, we'll create a tunnel with a reverse proxy. While we'll be using [`cloudflared`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) in this guide, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs) or another reverse proxy solution if you prefer.

While your app is still running, open another terminal window and start a network tunnel that listens to the port from the last step (in this case, port `5173`):

```
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173
```

When you run `cloudflared`, the tunnel will generate a public URL and you'll see output similar to the following:

```
Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at (it may take some time to be reachable):
https://funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com
```

Copy the URL from the output, as we'll need to add it to our app's settings.

### Set up your Activity URL Mapping

Because Activities are in a sandbox enviornment and go through the Discord proxy, you'll need to add a public URL mapping to serve your application and make external requests in your Activity. Since we're developing locally, we'll use the public endpoint we just set up.

Back in your app's settings, click on the **URL Mappings** page under **Activities** on the left-hand sidebar. Enter the URL you generated from `cloudflared` in the previous step.

![Configuring your URL Mapping](activities/url-mapping-tutorial.png)

| PREFIX | TARGET                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| `/`    | `funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com` |

Read details about URL Mapping [in the development guide](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/url-mapping).

### Running your Activity in Discord

Now that we are pointing Discord to our locally running app, we can launch the Activity in Discord!

Navigate to your Discord test server and, in any voice and or text channel, open the App Launcher where your in-development Activity should be present. If you don't see your Activity, you should try searching for its name.

Clicking on your app will launch your locally running app from inside Discord!

![Running your activity](activities/start-activity.png)

> info
> **Customizing your Activity** <br/> If you'd like to set images for your Activity, you can learn how to do that [here](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/setting-up-activity-metadata).

We're looking pretty good so far, but we haven't wired up any Discord functionality yet. Let's do that next.

<Collapsible title="Step 4 Checkpoint" icon="list" open>

By the end of Step 4, make sure you have:
- Set up a public endpoint
- Added an Activity URL Mapping in your app's settings
- Successfully launched your Activity in Discord
</Collapsible>

---

## Step 5: Authorizing & authenticating users

To authenticate your Activity with the users playing it, we must finish implementing our server-side app and get it talking to the client-side app.

We will use `express` for this example, but any backend language or framework will work here.

<Collapsible title="OAuth2 Flow Diagram" icon="view">

This diagram illustrates the common pattern for granting a user an OAuth2 access_token:

![Flow diagram for Oauth2](activities/oauth-flow-diagram.svg)

We will be implementing this pattern in this tutorial, but more example implementations can also be found in this sample project:

- [Back-end code](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk-examples/blob/main/discord-embedded-app-starter/packages/server/src/app.ts)
- [Front-end code](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk-examples/blob/main/discord-embedded-app-starter/packages/client/src/main.ts)

</Collapsible>

```
# move into our server directory
cd server

# install dependencies
npm install
```

We aren't going to edit the server code here, but it consists of a single POST route for `/api/token` that allows us to perform the OAuth2 flow from the server securely.

<Collapsible title="getting-started-activity/server/server.js" icon="view">

In the `getting-started-activity/server/server.js` file, the following code should already be present:

```javascript
import express from "express";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import fetch from "node-fetch";
dotenv.config({ path: "../.env" });

const app = express();
const port = 3001;

// Allow express to parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/api/token", async (req, res) => {

  // Exchange the code for an access_token
  const response = await fetch(`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
      client_id: process.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET,
      grant_type: "authorization_code",
      code: req.body.code,
    }),
  });

  // Retrieve the access_token from the response
  const { access_token } = await response.json();

  // Return the access_token to our client as { access_token: "..."}
  res.send({access_token});
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
</Collapsible>

Now, start the project's backend server:

```
npm run dev
```

You should output similar to the following:

```
> server@1.0.0 dev
> node server.js

Server listening at http://localhost:3001
```

We can now run our server and client-side apps in separate terminal windows. You can see other ways to set this up in the other [sample projects](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW/sample-projects).

### Calling external resources from your activity

Before we call your backend activity server, we need to be aware of the Discord proxy and understand how to avoid any Content Security Policy (CSP) issues.

> info
> For this tutorial, we are going to prefix the API call to `/api/token/` with `/.proxy`, but you can also use the SDK's `patchUrlMappings()` method to automatically prefix calls to your external resources for the proxy.

Learn more about this topic in the guides for [Constructing a Full URL](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/construct-a-full-url) and [Using External Resources](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/using-external-resources).

### Calling your backend server from your client

We're almost there! Now, we need our client application to communicate with our server so we can start the OAuth process and get an access token.

> info
> **What is vite.config.js?**<br />
> To allow our frontend app to call our Express server, Vite requires us to set up a proxy for `/api/*` to our backend server, which is running on port 3001. In their docs, you can learn more about [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

<Collapsible title="Calling the backend server" description="Code for authorizing and authenticating" icon="code" open>

Copy the following code in your project's `getting-started-activity/client/main.js` file:

```javascript
import { DiscordSDK } from "@discord/embedded-app-sdk";

import rocketLogo from '/rocket.png';
import "./style.css";

// Will eventually store the authenticated user's access_token
let auth;

const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID);

setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is authenticated");

  // We can now make API calls within the scopes we requested in setupDiscordSDK()
  // Note: the access_token returned is a sensitive secret and should be treated as such
});

async function setupDiscordSdk() {
  await discordSdk.ready();
  console.log("Discord SDK is ready");

  // Authorize with Discord Client
  const { code } = await discordSdk.commands.authorize({
    client_id: import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
    response_type: "code",
    state: "",
    prompt: "none",
    scope: [
      "identify",
      "guilds",
      "applications.commands"
    ],
  });

  // Retrieve an access_token from your activity's server
  // Note: We need to prefix our backend `/api/token` route with `/.proxy` to stay compliant with the CSP.
  // Read more about constructing a full URL and using external resources at
  // https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/development-guides#construct-a-full-url
  const response = await fetch("/.proxy/api/token", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      code,
    }),
  });
  const { access_token } = await response.json();

  // Authenticate with Discord client (using the access_token)
  auth = await discordSdk.commands.authenticate({
    access_token,
  });

  if (auth == null) {
    throw new Error("Authenticate command failed");
  }
}

document.querySelector('#app').innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <img src="${rocketLogo}" class="logo" alt="Discord" />
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </div>
`;
```
</Collapsible>

Now if we relaunch our app, we'll be prompted to authorize with Discord using the `identify`, `guilds`, and `applications.commands` scopes.

![Prompt to authorize Activity](activities/tutorial-auth.png)

> warn
> **Safe storage of tokens**<br />
> Access tokens and refresh tokens are powerful, and should be treated similarly to passwords or other highly-sensitive data. Store both types of tokens securely and in an encrypted manner.

<Collapsible title="Step 5 Checkpoint" icon="list" open>

By the end of Step 5, make sure you have:
- Updated your `client/main.js` to call the backend to support user authorization and authentication
- Been able to successfully complete the authorization flow for your app when opening your Activity
</Collapsible>

---

## Step 6: Use the SDK to fetch the channel

Now that we have authenticated our users, we can start interacting with contextual Discord information that we can use in our application.

Let's use the SDK to get details about the channel that our activity is running in. We can do this by writing a new async function that uses the `commands.getChannel` SDK method.

<Collapsible title="Fetching a channel using the SDK" icon="code" open>

In the same `getting-started-activity/client/main.js` file, paste the following function:

```javascript
async function appendVoiceChannelName() {
  const app = document.querySelector('#app');

  let activityChannelName = 'Unknown';

  // Requesting the channel in GDMs (when the guild ID is null) requires
  // the dm_channels.read scope which requires Discord approval.
  if (discordSdk.channelId != null && discordSdk.guildId != null) {
    // Over RPC collect info about the channel
    const channel = await discordSdk.commands.getChannel({channel_id: discordSdk.channelId});
    if (channel.name != null) {
      activityChannelName = channel.name;
    }
  }

  // Update the UI with the name of the current voice channel
  const textTagString = `Activity Channel: "${activityChannelName}"`;
  const textTag = document.createElement('p');
  textTag.textContent = textTagString;
  app.appendChild(textTag);
}
```

Now, update the callback after `setupDiscordSdk()` to call the function you just added:

```javascript
setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is authenticated");

  appendVoiceChannelName();
});
```

</Collapsible>

If you close and rejoin the Activity, you should now see the name of the current channel.

![Discord Activities](activities/tutorial-channel-name.png)

<Collapsible title="Step 6 Checkpoint" icon="list" open>

By the end of Step 6, make sure you have:
- Updated your `client/main.js` code to fetch the channel name using the SDK
- Added a call to the new function in the callback for `setupDiscordSdk()`
</Collapsible>

---

## Step 7: Use the API to fetch the guild

Since we requested the `identify` and `guilds` scopes, you can also use the authorized `access_token` we received earlier to fetch those resources via the API.

In the following code block, we will:
1. Call the [`GET /users/@me/guilds`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user-guilds) endpoint with `auth.access_token` to get a list of the guilds the authorizing user is in
2. Iterate over each guild to find the guild we are in based on the `guildId` defined in discordSdk
3. Create a new HTML image element with the guild avatar and append it to our frontend

> info
> In this example, we use a pure `fetch` request to make the API call, but you can us one of the JavaScript [community-built libraries](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_COMMUNITY_RESOURCES) if you prefer.

<Collapsible title="Fetching information about the current server" icon="code" open>

In the same `client/main.js` file, add the following function:

```javascript
async function appendGuildAvatar() {
  const app = document.querySelector('#app');

  // 1. From the HTTP API fetch a list of all of the user's guilds
  const guilds = await fetch(`https://discord.com/api/v10/users/@me/guilds`, {
    headers: {
      // NOTE: we're using the access_token provided by the "authenticate" command
      Authorization: `Bearer ${auth.access_token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  }).then((response) => response.json());

  // 2. Find the current guild's info, including it's "icon"
  const currentGuild = guilds.find((g) => g.id === discordSdk.guildId);

  // 3. Append to the UI an img tag with the related information
  if (currentGuild != null) {
    const guildImg = document.createElement('img');
    guildImg.setAttribute(
      'src',
      // More info on image formatting here: https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#image-formatting
      `https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/${currentGuild.id}/${currentGuild.icon}.webp?size=128`
    );
    guildImg.setAttribute('width', '128px');
    guildImg.setAttribute('height', '128px');
    guildImg.setAttribute('style', 'border-radius: 50%;');
    app.appendChild(guildImg);
  }
}
```

Then, call the new function in the callback for `setupDiscordSdk`:

```javascript
setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is authenticated");

  appendVoiceChannelName();
  appendGuildAvatar();
});
```

If we relaunch our Activity, we will see the current server's avatar render in our Activity.

At this point, you should have your Activity up and running. For Step 7, you should have:
- Updated your `client/main.js` code to fetch the guild information using the [`GET /users/@me/guilds`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user-guilds) API endpoint
- Added a call to the new function in the callback for `setupDiscordSdk()`

## Next Steps

Congrats on building your first Activity! 🎉

This is an intentionally simple example to get you started with the communication between your Activity and Discord using the Embedded App SDK and APIs. From here, you can explore the [Activities documentation](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW) and other resources.
