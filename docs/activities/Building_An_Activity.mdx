# Building Your First Activity in Discord

> preview
> Creating Activities is currently available as a [Public Developer Preview](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW/public-developer-preview).

## Introduction

Discord Activities are web applications that can run inside Discord. This allows you to build rich, multiplayer experiences inside of Discord.

If this is your first time learning about Activities, check out the [Activities Overview](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW) for more information and a collection of sample apps.

### Let's Jump In!

For your first Activity, we'll be building an app in JavaScript with the following goals:
- [Create a new Discord App](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_BUILDING_AN_ACTIVITY/step-1-creating-a-new-app)
- [Launch your app from within a voice channel](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_BUILDING_AN_ACTIVITY/step-4-running-your-app-locally-in-discord)
- [Authorize and authenticate with the user](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_BUILDING_AN_ACTIVITY/step-5-authorizing-authenticating-users)
- [Fetch and display the name of the current voice channel](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_BUILDING_AN_ACTIVITY/step-6-use-the-sdk-to-fetch-the-channel)
- [Fetch and display the avatar of the current server](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_BUILDING_AN_ACTIVITY/step-7-use-the-api-to-fetch-the-guild)

## Prerequisites

The [Embedded App SDK](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK) is intended to abstract away some of the complexities in building a Discord Activity, but developing a full-featured, multiplayer experience requires extensive experience with JavaScript and other web technologies.

If you are still learning to program, there are many free education resources to take advantage of:
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development)
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming)
- [Discord Developers Server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers)

Concepts that are important to know before continuing:

- [Asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function): You will be working with async JavaScript method calls to communicate with the Discord client and API
- [React](https://react.dev/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or another frontend framework for building user interfaces

> preview
> During the Developer Preview, it is recommended you create a new app for testing purposes. There are [limitations for Activities](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW/public-developer-preview) during this preview period.

## Step 1: Creating a new app

First, create a new app in the developer portal.

Enter a name for your app, select a team, then press **Create**.

![Create a new app](activities/new-app.png)

> info
> **Development Team Access** <br />While developing your application, it will only be launchable or joinable by your user or any member of your developer team. It often makes sense to make a [developer team](https://discord.com/developers/teams) and set the team as the application's owner, especially if you know you will collaborate with others during the development phase.

After you create your app, you'll land on the **General Overview** page of the app's settings, where you can update basic information about your app, like its description and icon.

### Configure Your Activity

Navigate to `Activities -> Getting Started` in the sidebar.

Review this page and press 'Get Started' to make your app eligible for being embedded.

![Configure your Activity](activities/getting-started-activities.png)

From the `Activities` section of the developer portal, you can configure:

- URL Mappings
- Settings
- Art Assets

We'll come back to this page later in this guide when we are ready to set up our URL Mappings.

### Find Your OAuth2 Credentials

To use Discord-related information, such as a user's username, avatar, or guild avatar, a user must agree to grant OAuth scopes to your application. Learn more about scopes [in the OAuth2 documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes).

There are two OAuth2 identifiers your app will need to reference: [CLIENT ID](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_BUILDING_AN_ACTIVITY/client-id) and [CLIENT SECRET](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_BUILDING_AN_ACTIVITY/client-secret), which are located on the `Settings -> OAuth2` tab on the developer portal.

Find these values and hold on to them for a later step.

<Collapsible title="How to find your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET" icon="view" open>

![oauth2-details](activities/oauth2-details.png)

### Client ID

Also known as the Application ID. This is the public facing id linked to your application.

### Client Secret

This is a private identifier that your app will use to grant an OAuth2 `access_token`. It should never be stored in the client-side JavaScript code.
</Collapsible>

### You must set up a OAuth2 redirect URI in order for this example to work.

The URI should point to the location where you host your app. If you don't yet have a url, you should fill in the field with a placeholder, such as https://127.0.0.1.

![Configure your Activity](activities/oauth2-redirect.png)

---

## Step 2: Setting up project files

We will use git to pull down a scaffolded project to help you get started quickly.

This tutorial's template includes a minimal frontend and backend with vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

When you build your applications, you can use whatever backend language and framework you prefer, but we will focus on JavaScript for this guide.

```
git clone git@github.com:discord/getting-started-activity.git
cd getting-started-activity
```

This git clone will pull down a template in a `getting-started-activity` directory for you to get started with.


```
├── client
│   ├── main.js       -> your Activity frontend
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── package.json
|   |── rocket.png
│   ├── vite.config.js
├── server
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── server.js     -> your Activity backend
└── .env              -> your credentials, ids and secrets
```

### Set Up Your Environment Variables

In the root of your project folder is an example.env file. Let's copy that example file into a new `.env` file.

```
cp example.env .env
```

`getting-started-activity/.env`
```
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID_HERE
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
```

> info
> **Why is there a VITE_ prefix before our Client ID?**<br />Prefixing the `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` environment variable with `VITE_` makes it accessible to our client-side code. This security measure ensures that only the variables you intend to be accessible in the browser are available, and all other environment variables remain private. [Read more in the Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode)

Any `VITE_` prefixed variables are then made available to us in our code via `import.meta.env` such as `import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`.

> warn
> **Secure Your Secrets**<br /> Your `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` should always be considered sensitive secrets. When using other programming languages and frameworks, it is safe to have your CLIENT_ID public and available to the browser.

### Set Up Your Frontend

Now that our environment variables are set up, let's spin up our frontend.


```
# from inside the getting-started-activity/ directory:

cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you visit http://localhost:5173/ you will see a vanilla JS frontend template running with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). If you look at the code from the template, you can see that it renders an image but is not calling any Discord APIs or backend services. We will come back to this later in the guide.

---

## Step 3: Installing the Embedded App SDK

With our frontend running, it's time to start integration with the Discord client!

<Collapsible title="Install the SDK to your package.json" open>

From inside our `getting-started-activity/client` folder, we will install the Embedded App SDK.

```
npm install @discord/embedded-app-sdk
```
</Collapsible>

This will add `@discord/embedded-app-sdk` to `getting-started-activity/client/package.json` and install the SDK in your `node_modules` folder.

Once installed, we need to import it into our client code and instantiate it to start the handshake between our app and the Discord client.

<Collapsible title="Add the SDK to your Project" open>

To instantiate the SDK, we will use the environment variables we set up earlier. The `VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` variable is available to us through `import.meta.env`.

We also set up our check for the `ready` event with an async/await function. This allows us to output a log or take action once the initial handshake was successful.

Let's import and instantiate the SDK in `getting-started-activity/client/main.js`:
```js
// Import the SDK
import { DiscordSDK } from "@discord/embedded-app-sdk";

import "./style.css";
import rocketLogo from '/rocket.png';

// Instantiate the SDK
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID);

setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is ready");
});

async function setupDiscordSdk() {
  await discordSdk.ready();
}

document.querySelector('#app').innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <img src="${rocketLogo}" class="logo" alt="Discord" />
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </div>
`;
```
</Collapsible>

> warn
> **Time to leave your browser behind**<br />Once you add the SDK to your app, you will **not** be able to view your app inside your web browser. In the next step, we will run your Activity inside of Discord. In the next step, we will go over how to view you app in Discord.

---

## Step 4: Running your app locally in Discord

Let's ensure everything is wired up correctly before we move on to authenticating with Discord.

To run your application locally, we recommend a network tunnel, such as `cloudflared` or `ngrok.`

In one terminal, let's start our client-side app:

```
cd client
npm run dev
```

`client terminal output`
```
VITE v5.0.12  ready in 100 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h + enter to show help
```

Let's start our network tunnel for port 5173 in another terminal window.

```
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173
```

When you run `cloudflared`, the tunnel will generate a public URL for you that we will use in the next step.

```
Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at (it may take some time to be reachable):
https://funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com
```

Let's copy that URL and take it into our next step.

### Set up your Activity URL Mapping

To serve your application, you must set up a URL mapping to where your app is hosted. For this tutorial, your app is hosted locally and being served via your network tunnel.

Click on `Activities` -> `URL Mappings` in your application settings. Enter the URL you generated from `cloudflared` in the previous step.

![Configuring your URL Mapping](activities/url-mapping-tutorial.png)

| PREFIX | TARGET                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| `/`    | `funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com` |

Read more about the specific rules and details for URL mapping [here](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/url-mapping).

### Enable Developer Mode in your Client

One more step before we can see our work inside of Discord!

If you haven't already, go to your `User Settings` -> `Advanced` and toggle on the `Developer Mode` setting. Developer Mode exposes context menu items for building apps, including giving you access to Activities that you are working on.

![Enabling Developer Mode in Settings](activities/developer-mode.gif)

### Running your Activity in Discord

Now that we are pointing Discord to our locally running app, we can launch it in Discord!

In a voice channel in your Discord server, click on the Activities icon (🚀) to see your Activity at the top of the Activity Shelf.

Clicking on your app will launch your locally running app from inside Discord!

![Running your activity](activities/start-activity.png)

> info
> **Customizing your Activity** <br/> If you'd like to set images for your Activity, you can learn how to do that [here](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES/setting-up-activity-metadata).

We're looking pretty good so far, but we haven't wired up any Discord functionality yet. Let's do that next.

---

## Step 5: Authorizing & authenticating users

To fully authenticate your activity with the users playing it, we must finish implementing our server-side app and get it talking to the client-side app.

We will use `express` for this example, but any backend language or framework will work here.

<Collapsible title="OAuth2 Flow Diagram" icon="view">

This diagram illustrates the common pattern for granting a user an OAuth2 access_token:

![Flow diagram for Oauth2](activities/oauth-flow-diagram.svg)

We will be implementing this pattern in this tutorial, but more example implementations can also be found in this sample project:

- [Back-end code](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/blob/main/examples/discord-embedded-app-starter/packages/server/src/app.ts)
- [Front-end code](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/blob/main/examples/discord-embedded-app-starter/packages/client/src/main.ts)

</Collapsible>

```
# move into our server directory
cd server

# install dependencies
npm install
```

We aren't going to edit the server code here, but it consists of a single POST route for `/API/token` that allows us to perform the Oauth2 flow from the server securely.

<Collapsible title="getting-started-activity/server/server.js" icon="view">
```javascript
import express from "express";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import fetch from "node-fetch";
dotenv.config({ path: "../.env" });

const app = express();
const port = 3001;

// Allow express to parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/api/token", async (req, res) => {

  // Exchange the code for an access_token
  const response = await fetch(`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
      client_id: process.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET,
      grant_type: "authorization_code",
      code: req.body.code,
    }),
  });

  // Retrieve the access_token from the response
  const { access_token } = await response.json();

  // Return the access_token to our client as { access_token: "..."}
  res.send({access_token});
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
</Collapsible>

```
npm run dev
```

`server terminal output`
```
> server@1.0.0 dev
> node server.js

Server listening at http://localhost:3001
```

We can now run our server and client-side apps in separate terminal windows. You can see other ways to set this up in our [Sample Projects](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_OVERVIEW/sample-projects).

### Calling your backend server from your client

We're almost there! Now, we need our client application to communicate with our server so we can start the OAuth process and get an access token.

> info
> **What is vite.config.js?**<br />
> To allow our frontend app to call our Express server, Vite requires us to set up a proxy for `/api/*` to our backend server, which is running on port 3001. In their docs, you can learn more about [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

`getting-started-activity/client/main.js`

```javascript
import { DiscordSDK } from "@discord/embedded-app-sdk";

import rocketLogo from '/rocket.png';
import "./style.css";

// Will eventually store the authenticated user's access_token
let auth;

const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID);

setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is authenticated");

  // We can now make API calls within the scopes we requested in setupDiscordSDK()
  // Note: the access_token returned is a sensitive secret and should be treated as such
});

async function setupDiscordSdk() {
  await discordSdk.ready();
  console.log("Discord SDK is ready");

  // Authorize with Discord Client
  const { code } = await discordSdk.commands.authorize({
    client_id: import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
    response_type: "code",
    state: "",
    prompt: "none",
    scope: [
      "identify",
      "guilds",
    ],
  });

  // Retrieve an access_token from your activity's server
  const response = await fetch("/api/token", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      code,
    }),
  });
  const { access_token } = await response.json();

  // Authenticate with Discord client (using the access_token)
  auth = await discordSdk.commands.authenticate({
    access_token,
  });

  if (auth == null) {
    throw new Error("Authenticate command failed");
  }
}

document.querySelector('#app').innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <img src="${rocketLogo}" class="logo" alt="Discord" />
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </div>
`;
```

Now if we relaunch our app, we'll be prompted to authorize with Discord using the `identify` and `guilds` scopes.

![Prompt to authorize Activity](activities/tutorial-auth.png)

> warn
> **Safe storage of tokens**<br />
> Access tokens and refresh tokens are powerful, and should be treated similarly to passwords or other highly-sensitive data. Store both types of tokens securely and in an encrypted manner.

> info
> If you want to remove the authorization, you can view your application under `Authorized Apps` under your user profile. If you click the `Deauthorize` button next to your app, you can go through the OAuth2 flow when you relaunch your activity.

---

## Step 6: Use the SDK to fetch the channel

Now that we have authenticated our users, we can start interacting with contextual Discord information that we can use in our application.

Let's use the SDK to get details about the voice channel that our activity is running in. We can do this by writing a new async function that uses the `commands.getChannel` SDK method.

`getting-started-activity/client/main.js`

```javascript
async function appendVoiceChannelName() {
  const app = document.querySelector('#app');

  let activityChannelName = 'Unknown';

  // Requesting the channel in GDMs (when the guild ID is null) requires
  // the dm_channels.read scope which requires Discord approval.
  if (discordSdk.channelId != null && discordSdk.guildId != null) {
    // Over RPC collect info about the channel
    const channel = await discordSdk.commands.getChannel({channel_id: discordSdk.channelId});
    if (channel.name != null) {
      activityChannelName = channel.name;
    }
  }

  // Update the UI with the name of the current voice channel
  const textTagString = `Activity Channel: "${activityChannelName}"`;
  const textTag = document.createElement('p');
  textTag.textContent = textTagString;
  app.appendChild(textTag);
}
```

Now, let's update the callback after `setupDiscordSdk()` to call our new function. If we close and rejoin our activity in Discord, we should now see the name of the current channel in our app!

```javascript
setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is authenticated");

  appendVoiceChannelName();
});
```

Now when we launch our Activity, we will dynamically see the name of our voice channel populate in our app.

![Discord Activities](activities/tutorial-channel-name.png)

---

## Step 7: Use the API to fetch the guild

Since we requested the `identify` and `guilds` scopes, you can also use the authorized `access_token` we received earlier to fetch those resources via the API.

- In the following code block, we will use the `/users/@me/guilds` endpoint in combination with `auth.access_token` to get a list of the guilds we are in.
- We will then iterate over each guild to find the guild we are in based on the `guildId` defined in discordSdk.
- Finally, we can create a new HTML image element with the guild avatar and append it to our application.

> info
> In this example, we use a pure `fetch` request to call the REST API. However, this is a great place to use your favorite Discord JavaScript library alongside the Embedded App SDK.

`getting-started-activity/client/main.js`

```javascript
async function appendGuildAvatar() {
  const app = document.querySelector('#app');

  // 1. From the HTTP API fetch a list of all of the user's guilds
  const guilds = await fetch(`https://discord.com/api/v10/users/@me/guilds`, {
    headers: {
      // NOTE: we're using the access_token provided by the "authenticate" command
      Authorization: `Bearer ${auth.access_token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  }).then((response) => response.json());

  // 2. Find the current guild's info, including it's "icon"
  const currentGuild = guilds.find((g) => g.id === discordSdk.guildId);

  // 3. Append to the UI an img tag with the related information
  if (currentGuild != null) {
    const guildImg = document.createElement('img');
    guildImg.setAttribute(
      'src',
      // More info on image formatting here: https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#image-formatting
      `https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/${currentGuild.id}/${currentGuild.icon}.webp?size=128`
    );
    guildImg.setAttribute('width', '128px');
    guildImg.setAttribute('height', '128px');
    guildImg.setAttribute('style', 'border-radius: 50%;');
    app.appendChild(guildImg);
  }
}
```

Finally, let's call our new function that uses the Discord API.

```javascript
setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is authenticated");

  appendVoiceChannelName();
  appendGuildAvatar();
});
```

If we relaunch our Activity, we will also see our the current server's avatar render in our app.
