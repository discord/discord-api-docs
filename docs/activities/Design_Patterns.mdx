# Activity Design Patterns

Before building your Activity, here are some guiding principles for you to consider for a successful user experience.

## Guiding Principles

### Interaction over Isolation
- Activities are not for screen-sharing, we already have that built-in!
- Give users a way to interact with one another.
- User actions should impact the experiences of other participants.

### Expression over Monotony
- Our users want to create memorable moments.
- Create experiences where users craft moments and react in ways they want to share with others.

### Accessibility over Exclusion
- Inclusivity is key. 
- Reduce the bar to entry for your Activity and reward people for engaging deeply with your experience.

## Providing a "Solo-Plus" Experience

Successful experiences will be built to accommodate small group sessions ("Plus"), but also playable and enjoyable for the case of single-player ("Solo") sessions.

### Solo or single-player
- While most people use Discord with small groups of friends. Consider experiences that are compelling alone, but better together!
- If you don't support solo play, expect to see a lot of users peeking into the Activity on their own. Consider what you can do to preview the Activity and compel them to come back with their friends.

### Solo-Plus or small groups of users
- Small group sessions (3-8 people) show more engagement and retention from users than single-player experiences.
- Letting players join with their friends keeps them coming back for more.

### Large groups of users
- While you can set a "max participants" suggestion to users, the only real limit is the number of people who can join a Voice call.
- Be aware of how your Activity will behave when there are 25 or more people in the call.

## User Presence & Privacy
When in an Activity with others, make the actions and presence of the others visible to each player. 

### Make actions and presence of the others visible to each player
    - Users enjoy participating in a space that feels active.
    - If a user has customized their server nickname or avatar, use their server nickname or avatar in game.
    - Show when a user is speaking in the voice call, or whether they're active or inactive.

### Respect user privacy
    - For Activity sessions that match users from various servers, usernames and avatars should be anonymized by default.
    - Discord personal identifiers should only be populated into the Activity with user confirmation.
    - Only use these identifiers when the people who can see them already have access via the server or DM.

## Deliver a Quality Experience

Make your app fast, easy to join, and maximize fun to launch a crowd favorite.

### Surprise and delight users
- Surprise and delight is about caring about the small details of how a person experiences your work.
- Put the right emotion in when they least expect it to deliver the magic.

### Keep load times as low as possible
- This allows for easier drop-in drop-out behavior for the large portion of mobile users on Discord.
- See the below [Quality & Testing Recommendations](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DESIGN_PATTERNS/quality-and-testing) for key areas of minimum quality support and testing recommendations.
- See the below [Technical Considerations](#DOCS_ACTIVITIES_DESIGN_PATTERNS/technical-considerations) for recommendations on how to partition loading and work with various development tools to reduce load times.
- Consider different screen sizes and orientations across desktop and mobile devices and make sure UI elements scale appropriately.

### Support drop-in, drop-out behavior

- Activities are frictionless to join and easy to discover, so you can expect that users will join mid-experience. Give those users something to do, even if it's just letting them spectate until they can join without being disruptive. In the same vein, users can leave without notice or become afk (away from keyboard). Handle these cases gracefully.
- Create a case for users who have joined a call but have not yet started playing or engaging. Allow these users to "spectate" other users who are playing. This can also be helpful for Activities that have an ideal number in mind for play.

### Make your app as available as possible

#### Cross-Platform Support
- Supporting desktop and mobile devices will expand your user-base to the widest number of users.
- Discord device usage is split between mobile and desktop platforms.

#### Discord is a Global Audience
    - Consider supporting a multitude of languages and cultures to make your app more useable for all Discord users.

#### Implement Invites
- The Embedded App SDK allows for sending invites from within an Activity out to other friended users.
- Add invite buttons to a screen or flow with intentionality, not only on the start screen and at the beginning. Examples of intentional Invite prompting include:
    - Cases where players leave the activity session
    - Cases where the minimum number of participants has not been reached (e.g. any activity that needs 2+ to start, or is more fun with more people, or when you need an opponent in a game like Chess.)

#### Implement Sharing

Discord is a social platform where users talk to each other. Sharing and invites lets your app live and engage in those shared spaces, making it visible and accessible to everyone not currently playing. Things like sharing and invites are important ways to reach into those private, shared spaces and attract other players.

- The Embedded App SDK allows for sending an image or gif from within an Activity.
    - Share photos or GIFs that capture moments of fun and memorable, or something to brag about. Don't make things shareable just to feature the activity.
    - Sharing a high score alone may not be very engaging, but sharing a really good move made in a game, or a collaborative drawing that creates a memory is a conversation starter and may make others want to join in on the fun.

#### Activities in Text Channels
- The Activity user interface, copy and user flows should not rely on people in voice to explain, organize, clarify, or instruct about how the activity works. 
- All controls, CTAs, and instructions should be clear enough that folks (especially first time users) playing in a text channel are able to quickly start using the app without needing to talk on voice to learn about it.
- Lean on dynamic first-time user experience and "How To Play" instructions, toast messages, Call To Action buttons, etc. but be careful to not over-clutter with copy.

### Monetization Considerations

> preview
> Monetization in Activities will be available soon. Keep the following considerations in mind as you design your Activity.

- Avoid prohibitive gates in front of participation (e.g. login wall / paywall), especially early in the user journey.
- Avoid monetized unlocks that give unfair advantage to other non-paying players or users (i.e. "pay to win").
- Take advantage of Discord as a social platform: look for opportunities to offer users customizable skins, aesthetic themes, new avatars, etc.

## Game Design Considerations

### Build games that are easy to learn, hard to master
- Players can often feel pressure when joining a multiplayer game (voice/video) in the moment if they’ve never played before.
- Games that have a simple quick reference control scheme that are easily approachable help ease players into an experience without dropping them into the deep end.
- An easy to understand game loop combined with easy to digest controls tends to work best. If you have to go through a tutorial to understand the game then it will be intimidating to join a game in the moment.

### Discord users who engage with voice are among our most engaged users
-  Activity engagement and retention increases when users are in a voice call with friends.

### Consider existing game expectations and tropes
- If you're developing a game, you're more likely to attract users who are gamers.
- Take advantage of existing tropes and expectations for games of the genre you're developing.
- Appeal to the player interests that your game (or game genre) provides, and support those interests as a means to get them coming back.

### Activities close when the last participant in the Activity leaves it
- The next time the Activity is launched, even if it’s in the same DM or Voice Channel, it will be a different instance and could have different participants.
- Note: This behavior will change in 2024, when we release persistent instances.
        
### If a game is launched, what % of the time do users reach different phases of the game?
- This includes launch → start, as there can be a large dropoff between these two (especially if you don’t support solo play or small group sizes).
- This also includes various check points in the game, including what % of sessions that start a game reach the end of that game!
- If your Activity has different settings you can start a game with, see if some are more popular or more successful — you may want to change your defaults!
    - For non-games, you may want to analyze a certain action instead (such as queueing a video / song for a co-watching / co-listening Activity).
- If drop-off is really high at a certain point, see if you can figure out why or change flows.

### How many games are played in a session?
- More games per session isn’t inherently better (you may have an Activity that is meant to be one long game), but is a good baseline to understand. 
- If you expect to see a lot of repeat plays per session and don’t, it can be worth digging in to understand more.

### How does the group size impact various key metrics? 
- For example, are larger sessions more or less likely to reach the end of a game? To replay? Etc.
- This can help you catch if your Activity has unexpected weak points in different group sizes — maybe the game drags on if there are too many people or isn’t compelling enough if there’s only two.
- Not every Activity needs to be built for robust group sizes, but if you have the option to play with X # of players, it’s good practice to make sure that experience is enjoyable for all involved!

## Co-Watching / Co-Listening

- Co-watching and co-listening should be more than just screen-sharing. Consider creative ways to to make each user's experience impacted by other participants.
- Consider providing host-controls so that playback isn't overly chaotic. If host controls are provided, make sure everyone can participate in some way, even if it's just recommending content to the host.
- If content is not available for everyone in the activity (for example, geo-restricted content), make sure that information is known when the content is queued and when it's playing. The host is generally interested in creating a good experience for their friends. Playback of content should be in sync with others in a local channel or call.
- Familiar design patterns can help to get people to participate in your Activity right away. Most Discord users are extremely familiar with media browsing (Spotify, YouTube, Netflix, etc.) and will immediately understand your content if you follow these patterns.
- Mobile device volume can be controlled by a device's built-in controls (volume buttons on the side of the device) and work as expected across desktop, mobile, and browsers.

## Technical Considerations

### Developing for the iframe

- Remember that you need to contend with the Discord Client itself for resources (CPU, RAM and GPU) as that client is still fully running while executing your Activity.
- Prioritize time-to-first-interaction.
- Minimize the amount of Web Assembly (WASM) as much as possible in your Activity.
    - Older iOS devices are especially affected by WebKit's optimization compilation pass of WASM that occurs during the first few minutes of usage of an Activity. To varying degrees, this will cause noticeable stutters, device thermal issues, and possibly degraded Discord's AV quality during those early minutes.
- All network traffic is routed through the Discord Proxy for various security reasons.
- Create multiple versions of your Activity in the Developer Portal for less and more stable development versioning (e.g. Development, Staging, Production). This allows you to show and test the last stable build while also having development and staging environments.

### Developing in Unity

Developing for the iframe in Unity is possible, but will likely require extensive min/maxing of all facets of your game to meet performance and quality standards. Other, web-first, game engines are generally more performant out of the box.

## Quality and Testing

### Verify User Interface and User Experience
- Ensure all buttons and UI elements function correctly without any blocking issues for standard Activity use or gameplay. 
- Test Discord usernames handling, ensuring they display appropriately based on the chosen format (Discord username or server identity).

### Test for Performance
- Evaluate performance to ensure it is satisfactory for the majority of users across phones, tablets, and desktop machines and across multiple operating systems. 
- Lag or slowness should not significantly impact the Activity or gameplay experience.

### Test for Audio
- Check that sound effects and background music work as intended, with volume settings functioning correctly.
- Being able to hear when playing on a voice call is important.

### Validate Activity Controls
- Confirm that all game controls, including clicks, drag, key controls, swiping, and hovers, work as expected and are suitable for the platform.
- Test in-app tutorials and instructions for accuracy and relevance to the current activity functionality and user platform (desktop or mobile).

### Mobile Device UI Considerations
- Watch out for potential issues on devices with top notches or cameras in specific corners that may hide or cut off UI elements and buttons, rendering them untappable.
- Be mindful of Android curved screen edges that could obscure or make elements and buttons inaccessible.
- Take into account iOS/Android swipe gestures that may interfere with UI elements or buttons located at the bottom of the screen.
- Ensure that Android devices with a back button do not overlap with elements or buttons at the bottom of the screen, preventing users from tapping them.
- Respect the safe area defined by the platform to prevent any buttons or content from being cut off or non-functional.

### Desktop Accessibility Guidelines
- Enable users to cycle through Discord buttons and fields on desktop by pressing TAB repeatedly, ensuring that the activity does not capture control.
- Implement the functionality for the ESC key to close any open in-activity modals, providing a consistent user experience.
- Opt for color-blind friendly colors with high contrast, especially for crucial game elements that need to be distinguishable based on color. 
- Avoid using similar colors for objects that are essential for gameplay but differ only in color, as this may pose challenges for color-blind users.
