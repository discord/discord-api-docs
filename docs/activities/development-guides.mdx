### Run Your Application Locally

It is possible to load your application via a localhost port or other unique URL. This URL must support an HTTPS connection to load on the web/desktop Discord app (HTTPS is not required for mobile). The downside to this flow is that your application's network traffic will not pass through Discord's proxy, which means any requests made by the application will need to use a full URL instead of a ["mapped"](/docs/activities/development-guides#url-mapping) URL.

To run your locally hosted application, follow the instructions for [Launching your Application from the Discord Client](/docs/activities/development-guides#launch-your-application-from-the-discord-client) and set the Application URL Override to the address of your application's web server.

### Running Your Application Through A Network Tunnel

Although it is possible to test your application locally, we recommend developing and testing against the Discord proxy. This is helpful to make sure all URLs behave as expected before your application runs in production. One technique to enable testing locally against the proxy is to use a network tunneling tool, such as [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared#installing-cloudflared). A typical pattern is for each developer to have their own "development-only" application. To set up a local environment to run through Discord's proxy, you will need to do the following:

1. Create a new application in the Discord Developer portal.
2. Enable Activities for your app.
3. Set up the application's [URL mapping](/docs/activities/development-guides#url-mapping).
4. Locally, spin up your web server.
5. Install and run a tunnel solution, such as [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared#installing-cloudflared). You will point it to your local web server.

:::info
Your web server can be HTTP and your network tunnel can upgrade the connection to HTTPS.
:::

If using cloudflared, you will run the following command, replace `3000` with your web server's port.

```
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

Once you run this command, you will receive your publicly accessible network tunnel address from cloudflared.

```
Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at (it may take some time to be reachable):
https://funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com
```

In the Discord Developer Portal, update the Application URL mapping for `/` url to `funky-jogging-bunny.trycloudflare.com` to match your network tunnel address and save your changes.

![Configuring your URL Mapping](images/activities/url-mapping-tutorial.png)

:::warn
If you do not own the URL that you are using to host the application (i.e. ngrok's free tier), someone else could claim that domain and host a malicious site in its place. Please be aware of these risks, and if you have to use a domain you do not own, be sure to reset your URL mapping when you are done using the tunnel.
:::

Follow the instructions for [Launching your Application from the Discord Client](/docs/activities/development-guides#launch-your-application-from-the-discord-client). Application URL Override should not be enabled.

### Running Your Application In Production

The flow for setting up your production application is very similar:

1. If not made yet, create a new application.
2. Enable Activities for your app.
3. Set up the application's [URL Mapping](/docs/activities/development-guides#url-mapping). The URL for your application's html should be set to the `/` route.
4. Follow the instructions for [Launching your Application from the Discord Client](/docs/activities/development-guides#launch-your-application-from-the-discord-client). Application URL Override should not be enabled.

This application now uses the same configuration it will use once it is fully published ✨.

### Launch your application from the Discord Client

You will be able to see and launch all activities owned by you or any teams you are a member of via the Developer Activity Shelf. One caveat is that the activity will not be shown on the current platform (web/ios/android) unless you have checked your platform in `Settings/Supported Platforms` on the developer portal.

To see you app inside of Discord in the Activity Shelf:

#### Web

1. Select ⚙️User Settings > App Settings > Advanced and toggle on `Developer Mode`
3. Close the settings window and enter a voice channel.
4. From either the RTC Panel or the Center Control Tray, click on the "Rocket Button" to open the Activity shelf. You should now see all of the same applications that you have access to in the developer portal. Note: The shelf will only include applications which have been flagged as "Embedded".
6. Click on an activity to launch it!

#### Mobile

1. From your User Profile, select Appearance, and then toggle "On" `Developer Mode`
2. Enter a voice channel
5. Click on an activity to launch it!

---

### URL Mapping

Activities in Discord are "sandboxed" via a Discord proxy. This is done to hide the users' IP addresses, your application's IP addresses, and to block URLs from known malicious endpoints. As an application owner, you can configure the proxy to allow network requests to external endpoints.

Because your application is "sandboxed", it will be unable to make network requests to external URLs. Let's say you want request `https://some-api.com`. To enable reaching this url from inside your application, you will create a new url mapping, with the `PREFIX` set to
`/api` and `TARGET` set to `some-api.com`. Now you can make requests to `/api` from inside of your application, which will be forwarded, via Discord's proxy to `some-api.com`.

#### How to set a URL Mapping

To add or modify your application's URL mappings, click on `Activities -> URL Mappings` and set the prefix and target values for each mapping as needed.

![Configuring your URL Mapping](images/activities/url-mapping-tutorial.png)

#### Prefix/Target formatting rules

- URL mappings can utilize any url protocol, (https, wss, ftp, etc...), which is why the URL target should not include a protocol. For example, for a URL target, do not put `https://your-url.com`, instead, omit `https://` and use `your-url.com`.
- Parameter matching can be used to help map external domain urls. For example, if an external url has many subdomains, such as `foo.google.com`, `bar.google.com`, then you could use the following mapping:
  | PREFIX                | TARGET                   |
  |-----------------------|--------------------------|
  | `/google/{subdomain}` | `{subdomain}.google.com` |
- Targets must point to a directory; setting a target to a file (e.g. `example.com/index.html`) is unsupported and may lead to unexpected behavior.
- Because of how URL globbing works, if you have multiple prefix urls with the same initial path, you must place the shortest of the prefix paths last in order for each url mapping to be reachable. For example, if you have `/foo` and `/foo/bar`, you must place the url `/foo/bar` before `/foo` or else the mapping for `/foo/bar` will never be reached.

| ✅ DO                                                        | ❌ DON'T                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requests mapped correctly                                   | Requests to /foo/bar will incorrectly be sent to `foo.com`      |
| ![url-mapping-do.png](images/activities/url-mapping-do.png) | ![url-mapping-dont.png](images/activities/url-mapping-dont.png) |

#### Exceptions

The aforementioned "sandbox" is enforced by a [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP). We have some notable exceptions to our CSP, meaning application clients may make requests to these URLs without hitting the proxy and therefore without establishing mappings. Notable exceptions include:

- `https://discord.com/api/`
- `https://canary.discord.com/api/`
- `https://ptb.discord.com/api/`
- `https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/`
- `https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/`
- `https://cdn.discordapp.com/icons/`
- `https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/`
- `https://media.discordapp.net/avatars/`
- `https://media.discordapp.net/icons/`

### Logging

By default, the SDK will send any console `log`, `warn`, `error`, `info`, and `debug` events triggered by your app to the Discord application.

#### Viewing Logs on Desktop

Desktop logs are viewable through the console tab inside a browser's Developer Tools. See the [Troubleshooting Console Log Errors](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001239472-Troubleshooting-Console-Log-Errors) support article for more information.

The Public Test Build (PTB) Discord client also allows inspecting your logs from the `View -> Developer -> Toggle Developer Tools` menu.  It can be downloaded at [https://discord.com/downloads](https://discord.com/downloads).

#### Viewing Logs on Mobile

Mobile logs are viewable via the `Debug Logs` option inside User Settings on the mobile App. It is only discoverable when you have `Developer Mode` enabled.

1. On the bottom navigation, tap on your avatar and then the gear icon to open your `User Settings`.
2. Tap `Appearance`.
3. Slide the `Developer Mode` toggle to ON.
4. The `Debug Logs` option will be available under the `DEV ONLY` section.

#### Filtering for Application Logs

Inside the Debug Logs view, you can search for your own application logs with the possible keywords:

- `RpcApplicationLogger`
- Your Application ID

Each log line is formatted as: `[RpcApplicationLogger] <application-id> - message`

The first section of Debug Logs are not your application logs but Discord specific app startup info which is not relevant to your application.

When you scroll down the page, your application logs should be visible.

![debug-logs-filtering](images/activities/debug-logs-filtering.gif)

#### Sharing Application Logs from Mobile

With `Developer Mode` enabled, you can share your application logs from within a Voice Channel.

1. In the voice channel, swipe from the bottom to see the expanded voice controls. Tap on `Share Application Logs`.
2. You'll be presented with a native share sheet where you can save the logs to a file or share it as a message.

#### Disabling Logging

If you do not want logs to be forwarded to the browser, you can disable it with the optional configuration object.

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(clientId, {
  disableConsoleLogOverride: true,
});
```

#### Forwarding Log Messages

You can forward specific log messages via the SDK command `captureLog` as shown below.

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(clientId);
await discordSdk.ready();
discordSdk.commands.captureLog({
  level: 'log',
  message: 'This is my log message!',
});
```

---

### Open External Link

Since Activities are sandboxed, your app will need to perform a command in order for users to launch any external links. Users will be prompted inside Discord whether or not they want to open the external link.

#### Usage

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(clientId);
await discordSdk.ready();
// Once the sdk has established the connection with the discord client, external
// links can be launched
discordSdk.commands.openExternalLink({
  url: 'https://google.com',
});
```

#### User Experience

![external-link-modal](images/activities/external-link-modal.png)

Users will see a modal inside the Discord app notifying them whether or not they want to proceed. By clicking **_Trust this Domain_**, users will not see a modal for that specific domain again.

---

### Open Invite Dialog

Getting an Application Channel Invite, as outlined in [these docs](/docs/resources/invite#get-invite), is not granted by any OAuth scopes. Nonetheless, the `openInviteDialog` command is available via the SDK. This command opens the Application Channel Invite UI within the discord client without requiring additional OAuth scopes.

This command returns an error when called from DM (Direct Message) contexts, so should only be called in Guild Voice or Text Channels. Similarly, this command returns an error if the user has invalid permissions for the channel, so using `getChannelPermissions` (requires OAuth scope `'guilds.members.read'`) is highly recommended.

#### Usage

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK, Permissions, PermissionUtils} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(clientId);
await discordSdk.ready();

try {
  const {permissions} = await discordSdk.commands.getChannelPermissions();
  if (PermissionUtils.can(Permissions.CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE, permissions)) {
    await discordSdk.commands.openInviteDialog();
    // successfully opened dialog
  } else {
    console.warn('User does not have CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE permissions');
  }
} catch (err) {
  // failed to fetch permissions or open dialog
  console.warn(err.message);
}
```

User Experience

![Invite Dialog UI](images/activities/invite-dialog.png)

Users will see a modal inside the Discord app allowing them to send an invite to a channel, friend, or copy an invite link to share manually.

---

### Open Share Moment Dialog

The easiest way for an application to share media to a channel or DM is to use the `openShareMomentDialog` command. This command accepts a Discord CDN `mediaUrl` (eg `https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...`) and opens a dialog on the discord client that allows the user to select channels, DMs, and GDMs to share to. This requires no additional OAuth scopes, but does require the application to be authenticated.

Since `mediaUrl` must be a Discord CDN URL, it is encouraged to use the activities attachment API endpoint (`discord.com/api/applications/${applicationId}/attachment`) to create an ephemeral CDN URL. This endpoint accepts bearer tokens for any scopes, so it can be called from the application client using the authorized user's bearer token. The endpoint returns a serialized attachment, which includes a `url` attribute, which should then be passed to the DiscordSDK command as `mediaUrl`.

#### Usage

```javascript
import {discordSdk} from './wherever-you-initialize-your-sdk';
import {accessToken} from './wherever-you-store-your-access-token';

// some image
const imageURL = 'https://i.imgur.com/vaSWuKr.gif';

// get image data
const response = await fetch(imageURL);
const blob = await response.blob();
const mimeType = blob.type;

// image data as buffer
const buf = await blob.arrayBuffer();

// image as file
const imageFile = new File([buf], 'example.gif', {type: mimeType});

const body = new FormData();
body.append('file', imageFile);

const attachmentResponse = await fetch(`${env.discordAPI}/applications/${env.applicationId}/attachment`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
  },
  body,
});
const attachmentJson = await attachmentResponse.json();

// mediaUrl is an ephemeral Discord CDN URL
const mediaUrl = attachmentJson.attachment.url;

// opens dialog in Discord client
await discordSdk.commands.openShareMomentDialog({mediaUrl});
```

### Setting Up an Entry Point Command

An [Entry Point command](/docs/interactions/application-commands#entry-point-commands) is required for users to be able to launch your Activity from the [App Launcher menu](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/21334461140375-Using-Apps-on-Discord#h_01HRQSA6C8TRHS722P1H3HW1TV) in Discord.

When you enable Activities in your [app's settings](http://discord.com/developers/applications), a [default Entry Point command](/docs/interactions/application-commands#default-entry-point-command) is automatically created for your app. The default Entry Point command will use the `DISCORD_LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` (`2`) [handler type](/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-entry-point-command-handler-types), which means that Discord automatically launches your Activity for the user and posts a follow-up message into the channel where it was launched from.

If you want to handle sending messages yourself, you can update the handler to be `APP_HANDLER` (`1`). Details about Entry Point command handlers is in the [Entry Point command documentation](/docs/interactions/application-commands#entry-point-handlers).

#### Customizing the Default Entry Point Command

Entry Point commands can be customized in the same way as other [commands](/docs/interactions/application-commands). Since Entry Point commands can only be [global](/docs/interactions/application-commands#making-a-global-command), you'll use the HTTP endpoints for global  commands:
- **Edit your existing Entry Point command's name or details** using the [Edit Global Application Command](/docs/interactions/application-commands#edit-global-application-command) endpoint. If you don't know the ID for your app's Entry Point command, use the [Get Global Application Commands](/docs/interactions/application-commands#get-global-application-commands) endpoint to retrieve it.
- **Make a different (option-less) command your Entry Point command** by updating its [command `type`](/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-types) to `PRIMARY_ENTRY_POINT` (type `4`). Your app can only have one Entry Point command, so if your app already has one, you must first [delete](/docs/interactions/application-commands#delete-global-application-command) it or [update](/docs/interactions/application-commands#edit-global-application-command) its [command `type`](/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-types).

#### Creating an Entry Point Command

To create a new Entry Point command, you can call the [Create Global Application Command](/docs/interactions/application-commands#create-global-application-command) endpoint and set the [command `type`](/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-command-object-application-command-types) to `PRIMARY_ENTRY_POINT` (type `4`).

Your command payload may look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "launch",
  "description": "Launch Realms of Wumpus",
  // PRIMARY_ENTRY_POINT is type 4
  "type": 4,
  // DISCORD_LAUNCH_ACTIVITY is handler value 2
  "handler": 2,
  // integration_types and contexts define where your command can be used (see below)
  "integration_types": [0, 1],
  "contexts": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

In addition to the `type` and `handler` values, the command payload includes `integration_types` and `contexts` which let you configure when and where your command can be used:
- `integration_types` defines the [installation contexts](/docs/resources/application#installation-context) where your command is available (to a server, to a user's account, or both). If you don't set `integration_types` when creating a command, it will default to your app's [currently-supported installation contexts](/docs/resources/application#setting-supported-installation-contexts).
- `contexts` defines the [interaction contexts](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-context-types) where a command can be run in Discord (in a server, in a DM with your app, and/or in DMs and Group DMs with other users).

Details about both of these fields are in the [command contexts](/docs/interactions/application-commands#contexts) documentation.

---

### Encourage Hardware Acceleration

Activities that are compute intensive may benefit from encouraging users to enable hardware acceleration. When an application invokes the `encourageHardwareAcceleration` command the current status of the setting will be returned and the user will be prompted to update the setting, if applicable.

Users will see a modal inside the Discord app if Hardware Acceleration is disabled, encouraging them to change the setting. By clicking **Don't show me this again** they will not see the modal for _any application_ on this device again.

#### Best Practices

Switching the Hardware Acceleration setting causes the Discord client to quit and re-launch, so it is best practice to invoke this command as soon as possible, so users do not begin the experience of an application before restarting. Ideally, this is immediately after `await discordSdk.ready()`.

#### Usage

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(clientId);
await discordSdk.ready();
const {enabled} = await discordSdk.commands.encourageHardwareAcceleration();
console.log(`Hardware Acceleration is ${enabled === true ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}`);
```

#### User Experience

![encourage-hardware-acceleration-modal](images/activities/encourage-hardware-acceleration-modal.png)


---

### Supported Platforms: Web, iOS, Android

By default, your Activity will be launchable on web/desktop. To enable or disable support for Web/iOS/Android, do the following:

- Visit the developer portal
- Select your application
- Select `Activities` -> `Settings` in the left-side of the developer portal, or visit `https://discord.com/developers/<your app id>/embedded/settings`
- From check the appropriate checkboxes in the developer portal, and save your changes

![supported-platforms](images/activities/supported-platforms.png)

---

### Mobile Safe Areas

As an example, you can define your safe area insets as below in CSS:

```
:root {
  --sait: var(--discord-safe-area-inset-top, env(safe-area-inset-top));
  --saib: var(--discord-safe-area-inset-bottom, env(safe-area-inset-bottom));
  --sail: var(--discord-safe-area-inset-left, env(safe-area-inset-left));
  --sair: var(--discord-safe-area-inset-right, env(safe-area-inset-right));
}
```

This prefers the `--discord-safe-area-inset-*` variable and will fallback to the env values for iOS + any local dev testing that is done outside of Discord.

You can then reference these values:

```
body {
  padding-left: var(--sail);
  padding-right: var(--sair);
  padding-top: var(--sait);
  padding-bottom: var(--saib);
}
```

---

### Mobile Thermal States

You may need to respond to thermal state changes using recommendations from [thermal states surfaced by mobile devices](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/power_efficiency_guidelines_osx/RespondToThermalStateChanges.html) to improve the user experience.

Discord's Embedded App SDK provides an abstraction over [Apple's thermal state APIs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/power_efficiency_guidelines_osx/RespondToThermalStateChanges.html) and [Android's thermal state APIs](https://source.android.com/docs/core/power/thermal-mitigation#thermal-api).

Here's how Discord's abstraction maps to Apple's thermal states and Android's thermal states.

```javascript
enum ThermalState {
  NOMINAL = 0, // maps to "nominal" on iOS and "none" on Android
  FAIR = 1, // maps to "fair" on iOS and "light" / "moderate" on Android
  SERIOUS = 2, // maps to "serious" on iOS and "severe" on Android
  CRITICAL = 3, // maps to "critical" on iOS and "critical" / "emergency" / "shutdown" on Android
}
```

The Embedded App SDK allows developers to subscribe to these thermal state changes.

```javascript
const handleThermalStateUpdate = (update: {thermal_state: number}) => {
  switch (thermalState) {
      case Common.ThermalStateTypeObject.NOMINAL:
        ...
      case Common.ThermalStateTypeObject.FAIR:
        ...
      case Common.ThermalStateTypeObject.SERIOUS:
        ...
      case Common.ThermalStateTypeObject.CRITICAL:
        ...
      default:
        ...
    }
}

discordSdk.subscribe('THERMAL_STATE_UPDATE', handleThermalStateUpdate);
```

Discord will publish the current thermal state upon event subscription, and it will also publish any thermal state changes that happen afterward.

:::info
On Android devices, the thermal state updates will only be available on Android 10 and higher.

### Application Orientation

#### Locking Application Orientation

This SDK provides APIs for locking the application to specific orientations. The possible lock states are `UNLOCKED`, `PORTRAIT`, and `LANDSCAPE`. `lock_state` is the default lock state, and it affects the app orientation when the application is focused. `picture_in_picture_lock_state` determines the PIP aspect ratio, and `grid_lock_state` determines the grid tile aspect ratio for the application. When `picture_in_picture_lock_state` is not set, the application PIP falls back to `lock_state` to determine the aspect ratio. When `grid_lock_state` is not set, the application grid tile falls back to `picture_in_picture_lock_state` to determine its aspect ratio, and if `picture_in_picture_lock_state`is not set, it uses `lock_state`.

Calling `setOrientationLockState` with an `undefined` or omitted value for `picture_in_picture_lock_state` or `grid_lock_state` will not change the corresponding lock states for the application. Calling `setOrientationLockState` with a null value for `picture_in_picture_lock_state` or `grid_lock_state` will clear the application's corresponding lock states such that those layout modes will use the fallback lock states.

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK, Common} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(clientId);
await discordSdk.ready();

// Set a default lock state
discordSdk.commands.setOrientationLockState({lock_state: Common.OrientationLockStateTypeObject.LANDSCAPE});

// or set both a default lock state and a picture-in-picture lock state
discordSdk.commands.setOrientationLockState({
  lock_state: Common.OrientationLockStateTypeObject.PORTRAIT,
  picture_in_picture_lock_state: Common.OrientationLockStateTypeObject.LANDSCAPE,
  grid_lock_state: Common.OrientationLockStateTypeObject.LANDSCAPE,
});
```

#### Configuring Default Orientation Lock State Through the Developer Portal

It's also possible to configure an application with a default orientation lock state via the Developer Portal. Using this method, the Discord app will apply the orientation lock when launching the application before the SDK has been initialized. This can create a smoother application launch flow where the application starts in the correct orientation rather than switching to the correct orientation after some delay after the application requests an orientation lock via the SDK. The Developer Portal supports setting a different default orientation lock states for phones versus tablets.

![default-orientation-lock-state](images/activities/default_orientation_lock_state.png)

#### Subscribing to Screen Orientation Updates

To listen to the screen orientation (which is sometimes different from the physical device orientation), subscribe to the `ORIENTATION_UPDATE` event. Discord will publish the current orientation upon event subscription, and it'll also publish any orientation changes that happen afterward.

```javascript
const handleOrientationUpdate = (update: {screen_orientation: number}) => {
  switch (update.screen_orientation) {
      case Common.OrientationTypeObject.PORTRAIT:
        ...
      case Common.OrientationTypeObject.LANDSCAPE:
        ...
      default:
        ...
    }
}

discordSdk.subscribe('ORIENTATION_UPDATE', handleOrientationUpdate);
```

---

### Application Layout Mode

There are three layout modes that an application can be in: focused, picture-in-picture (PIP), or grid mode. Activities can subscribe to the layout mode to determine when to optionally change their layouts to optimize for each layout mode. Old Discord clients only support the `ACTIVITY_PIP_MODE_UPDATE` event, while new Discord clients support both `ACTIVITY_PIP_MODE_UPDATE` and `ACTIVITY_LAYOUT_MODE_UPDATE`. Use `subscribeToLayoutModeUpdatesCompat` and `unsubscribeFromLayoutModeUpdatesCompat` to subscribe to both events with backward compatibility for old Discord clients that only support `ACTIVITY_PIP_MODE_UPDATE`. Here's an example using React:

```javascript
export default function LayoutMode() {
  const handleLayoutModeUpdate = React.useCallback((update: {layout_mode: number}) => {
       ...
  }, []);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    discordSdk.subscribeToLayoutModeUpdatesCompat(handleLayoutModeUpdate);
    return () => {
      discordSdk.unsubscribeFromLayoutModeUpdatesCompat(handleLayoutModeUpdate);
    };
  }, [handleLayoutModeUpdate]);
}
```

### Activity Proxy Considerations

All network traffic is routed through the Discord Proxy for various security reasons.

Under the hood we utilize Cloudflare Workers, which brings some restrictions, outlined below.

#### WebTransport

While we currently only support websockets, we're working with our upstream providers to enable WebTransport.

#### WebRTC

WebRTC is not supported.

Other guides are available in this [Networking](/docs/activities/development-guides#networking) section for using external network resources and constructing a full url versus relative urls.

---

### Construct A Full URL

There are scenarios where instead of using a relative url (`/path/to/my/thing`) you may want or need to reference the full url when making a network request. The URL is a combination of the following

1. The protocol you wish to use
2. Your application's client id
3. The discord proxy domain
4. The `/.proxy` path prefix
5. Whatever you need to list

Here's an example of how to build a full url, using the URL constructor:

```javascript
const protocol = `https`;
const clientId = '<YOUR CLIENT ID>';
const proxyDomain = 'discordsays.com';
const resourcePath = '/foo/bar.jpg';
const url = new URL(`${protocol}://${clientId}.${proxyDomain}/.proxy${resourcePath}`);
```

In other words, given an application client id of `12345678`
| Relative Path | Full Path                                           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| /foo/bar.jpg  | https://12345678.discordsays.com/.proxy/foo/bar.jpg |

---

### Using External Resources

Activities in Discord are "sandboxed" via a Discord proxy. This is done to hide the users' IP addresses as well as block URLs from known malicious endpoints. To achieve this, the Discord Developer Portal has a section for [configuring URL Mappings](/docs/activities/development-guides#url-mapping) for your application.

One edge-case of URL mappings is that third-party NPM modules or other resources may reference external (non-sandboxed) urls.

For example, if your application has an npm module that attempts to make an http request to https://foo.library.com, the request will fail with a `blocked:csp` error.

To get around this limitation there are several options to consider:

- Fork the library (to use mapped urls)
- Utilize a post-install utility such as [patch-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package)
- Use our Embedded App SDK's `patchUrlMappings` API

In the above scenario, we recommend using the `patchUrlMappings` API, as it will allow a smooth transition from the non-sandboxed dev environment to the production environment.

This method call takes an array of "mappings" which will transform any external network requests to the mappings you've defined.

See the example below:

- In this example, imagine you have a third-party library which makes an HTTP request to foo.com
- In the developer portal, create a mapping like this: `/foo` -> `foo.com`
- Then in your code, when initializing the SDK, you will make a function call.


```javascript
import {patchUrlMappings} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'; // Actual dev/prod env check may vary for you

async function setupApp() {
  if (isProd) {
    patchUrlMappings([{prefix: '/foo', target: 'foo.com'}]);
  }
  // start app initialization after this....
}
```

:::info
Note: `patchUrlMappings` is modifying your browser's `fetch`, `WebSocket`, and `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open` global variables. Depending on the library, you may see side effects from using this helper function. It should be used only when necessary.
:::

---

### Security Considerations

#### Trusting Client Data

Do not trust data coming from the Discord client as truth. It's fine to use this data in your application locally, but assume any data coming from the Discord Client could be falsified. That includes data about the current user, their nitro status, their current channel, etc. If you need this information in a trusted manner, contact Discord API directly from your application's server, with the user token you received from completing the OAuth2 flow.

Furthermore, data coming from the Discord client is not sanitized beforehand.  Things like usernames and channel names are arbitrary user input.  Make sure to sanitize these strings or use `.textContent` (for example) to display them safely in your UI.

#### Using Cookies

To set a cookie for your activity to use in network requests through the proxy, make sure the cookie's domain matches your app's full `{clientId}.discordsays.com` domain. You will also need to explicitly set `SameSite=None Partitioned` on the cookie. `SameSite=None` is needed as browsers refuse to store or send cookies with higher restriction levels for any navigation within an iframe. `Partitioned` then limits the use of that cookie to only Discord's iframes.

Rest assured: other activities will not be able to make requests with your activity's cookie, thanks to the Content Security Policy (CSP) limiting requests only to your own app's proxy.

---

### Activity Instance Management

When a user clicks "Join Application", they expect to enter the same application that their friends are participating in. Whether the application is a shared drawing canvas, board game, collaborative playlist, or first-person shooter; the two users should have access to the same shared data. In this documentation, we refer to this shared data as an **application instance**.

![join-application](images/activities/join-application.png)

The Embedded App SDK allows your app to talk bidirectionally with the Discord Client. The `instanceId` is necessary for your application, as well as Discord, to understand which unique instance of an application it is talking to.

#### Using instanceId

The `instanceId` attribute is available as soon as the SDK is constructed, and does not require the SDK to receive a `ready` payload from the Discord client.

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';
const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(clientId);
// available immediately
const instanceId = discordSdk.instanceId;
```

The `instanceId` should be used as a key to save and load the shared data relevant to an application. This ensures that two users who are in the same application instance have access to the same shared data.

##### Semantics of instanceId

Instance IDs are generated when a user launches an application. Any users joining the same application will receive the same `instanceId`. When all the users of an application in a channel leave or close the application, that instance has finished its lifecycle, and will not be used again. The next time a user opens the application in that channel, a new `instanceId` will be generated.

---

### Instance Participants

Instance Participants are any Discord user actively connected to the same Application Instance. This data can be fetched or subscribed to.

```javascript
import {DiscordSDK, Events, type Types} from '@discord/embedded-app-sdk';

const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK('...');
await discordSdk.ready();

// Fetch
const participants = await discordSdk.commands.getInstanceConnectedParticipants();

// Subscribe
function updateParticipants(participants: Types.GetActivityInstanceConnectedParticipantsResponse) {
  // Do something really cool
}
discordSdk.subscribe(Events.ACTIVITY_INSTANCE_PARTICIPANTS_UPDATE, updateParticipants);
// Unsubscribe
discordSdk.unsubscribe(Events.ACTIVITY_INSTANCE_PARTICIPANTS_UPDATE, updateParticipants);
```

---

### Render Avatars and Names

Check out detailed documentation on where and how Discord stores common image assets [here](/docs/reference#image-formatting-cdn-endpoints).

Here's a basic example for retrieving a user's avatar and username

```javascript
// We'll be referencing the user object returned from authenticate
const {user} = await discordSdk.commands.authenticate({
  access_token: accessToken,
});

let avatarSrc = '';
if (user.avatar) {
  avatarSrc = `https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/${user.id}/${user.avatar}.png?size=256`;
} else {
  const defaultAvatarIndex = (BigInt(user.id) >> 22n) % 6n;
  avatarSrc = `https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/${defaultAvatarIndex}.png`
}

const username = user.global_name ?? `${user.username}#${user.discriminator}`;

// Then in your HTML/JSX/etc...
<img alt="avatar" src={avatarSrc} />
<p>{username}</p>
```

#### Rendering guild-specific avatars and nicknames

In order to retrieve a user's guild-specific avatar and nickname, your application must request the `guilds.members.read` scope. Note, this only grants the information for that instance of the application's user. To display the guild-specific avater/nickname for all application users, any info retrieved from `guilds.members.read` scope'd API calls must be shared via your application's server.

Here's an example of how to retrieve the user's guild-specific avatar and nickname:

```javascript
// We'll be referencing the user object returned from authenticate
const {user} = await discordSdk.commands.authenticate({
  access_token: accessToken,
});

// When using the proxy, you may instead replace `https://discord.com` with `/discord`
// or whatever url mapping you have chosen via the developer portal
fetch(`https://discord.com/api/users/@me/guilds/${discordSdk.guildId}/member`, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
  },
})
  .then((response) => {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((guildsMembersRead) => {
    let guildAvatarSrc = '';
    // Retrieve the guild-specific avatar, and fallback to the user's avatar
    if (guildsMembersRead?.avatar) {
      guildAvatarSrc = `https://cdn.discordapp.com/guilds/${discordSdk.guildId}/users/${user.id}/avatars/${guildsMembersRead.avatar}.png?size=256`;
    } else if (user.avatar) {
      guildAvatarSrc = `https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/${user.id}/${user.avatar}.png?size=256`;
    } else {
      const defaultAvatarIndex = (BigInt(user.id) >> 22n) % 6n;
      avatarSrc = `https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/${defaultAvatarIndex}.png`;
    }

    // Retrieve the guild-specific nickname, and fallback to the username#discriminator
    const guildNickname = guildsMembersRead?.nick ?? (user.global_name ?? `${user.username}#${user.discriminator}`);
  });
```

This example is being done entirely on the client, however, a more common pattern is to instead, do the following:

- Store the user's access token on the application server
- Retrieve the user's guild-specific avatar and nickname via the application's server
- Serve all of the application's avatar/nicknames via the application's server

### Prompting Users to Share Incentivized Links

Incentivized sharing can help grow your Activity through network effects. You can use links in several different ways such as:

- **Referral links.** Users can copy referral links inside your Activity, which include their Discord user ID (`https://discord.com/activities/<your Activity ID>?referrer_id=123456789`), and they can send to their friends. If their friend accepts and starts playing your game, then you gift the referrer something inside your game.
- **Promotions.** You can run a temporary promotion on social media, where you offer a reward if they start playing now. Share a custom link on your social media (`https://discord.com/activities/<your Activity ID>?custom_id=social012025` ). Anyone who clicks that specific link receives something inside your game.
- **Social deep-links.** Currently, when users launch an Activity, they all land in the same place. Instead, you can start deep-linking to contextually relevant points in your game. For example, user A can copy a link inside your Activity for engaging other users (`https://discord.com/activities/<your Activity ID>?referrer_id=123456789&custom_id=visit-location`), and sends the link to their friends in a DM or channel. Then, user B who clicks the link gets taken directly to user A’s location.
- **Turn-based deep-links.** When you send an “it’s your turn” DM to a user, you can include a link which takes them directly to the right game instance and the turn they need to take.
- **Affiliate marketing.** You can work with affiliates (influencers, companies, etc) to advertise your game to their followings, and reward them via a custom link (`https://discord.com/activities/<your Activity ID>?custom_id=influencer1`). Then, for every user that starts playing because of said influencer, you can then pay out to the influencer.
- **Source attribution.** You can use the `custom_id` parameter to figure out how much traffic you’re getting from different marketing sources.

This guide covers implementing a referral link which will feature a reward system for users who share links and those who click them.

#### Implementation Overview

1. Create and track an incentivized link for a promotional campaign, then prompt users to share the link
2. Handle incoming referrals and grant valid rewards

#### Sharing Links

When implementing sharing, you'll need to:
1. Generate a unique ID for tracking the promotion
2. Call the [`shareLink`](/docs/developer-tools/embedded-app-sdk#sharelink) command
3. Track the share attempt

```javascript
// Generate a unique ID for this promotion
// This could be per-campaign, per-user, or per-share depending on your needs
const customId = await createPromotionalCustomId();

try {
    const { success } = await discordSdk.commands.shareLink({
        message: 'Click this link to redeem 5 free coins!',
        custom_id: customId,
    });

    if (success) {
        // Track successful share for analytics/limiting
        await trackSuccessfulShare(customId);
    }
} catch (error) {
    // Handle share failures appropriately
    console.error('Failed to share link:', error);
}
```

#### Handling Incoming Referrals

When a user clicks a shared link, your activity will launch with referral data available through the SDK:

```javascript
// Early in your activity's initialization
async function handleReferral() {
    // Validate the referral data
    if (!discordSdk.customId || !discordSdk.referrerId) {
        return;
    }

    try {
        // Verify this is a valid promotion and hasn't expired
        const promotion = await validatePromotion(discordSdk.customId);
        if (!promotion) {
            console.log('Invalid or expired promotion');
            return;
        }

        // Prevent self-referrals
        if (discordSdk.referrerId === currentUserId) {
            console.log('Self-referrals not allowed');
            return;
        }

        // Grant rewards to both users
        await grantRewards({
            promotionId: discordSdk.customId,
            referrerId: discordSdk.referrerId,
            newUserId: currentUserId
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to process referral:', error);
    }
}
```

#### Link Sharing Best Practices

- Generate unique, non-guessable `customId`s
- Track and validate referrals to prevent abuse
- Handle edge cases like expired promotions gracefully
- Consider implementing cool-down periods between shares
- Do not override the `referrer_id` query parameter directly. When present, `referrer_id` is expected to be a Discord snowflake-type user ID, otherwise it will be set to the message's author id.

---

### Creating and Managing Custom Incentivized Links

This guide covers creating a customizable [Incentivized Link](/docs/activities/development-guides#prompting-users-to-share-incentivized-links) through the dev portal, and then retrieving the link to be able to share it off-platform. Incentivized Links are used to customize how the embed appears to users.

#### Creating a Link

1. In your Application's portal, visit the Custom Links page under the Activities heading in the navigation pane.
2. On the Custom Links page, click `Create New` to create a new link.
3. You will need to upload an image with an aspect ratio of 43:24.
4. Title, and description are also required.
5. `custom_id` is an optional field, an explicit `custom_id` query parameter on the link itself will always override the set `custom_id`.
6. Click Save.

#### Editing a Link

1. Click on a row to open up the modal with all of the data loaded in ready for your edits.
2. Change the description to something else.
3. Click Update.

#### Copying a Link

Once you're satisfied with your changes you can click on the copy icon on the row, it'll change colors to green indicating that it copied to your clipboard. You are now able to share this link anywhere. The link will look like: `https://discord.com/activities/<your Activity ID>?link_id=0-123456789`. Even if you've set a `custom_id`, it won't be explicitly included in the link but will be loaded once a user clicks on the link. You can then further shorten this URL if you'd like.

#### Deleting a Link

1. Click on the trash icon on the row of the link you're trying to delete.
2. You'll have a confirm dialog pop up.

:::warn
Deleting is irreversible and immediate. Ensure that your link isn't in active use before deleting and/or that your activity gracefully handles any click-throughs from the link.
:::

#### Best Practices

- Generate unique, non-guessable `customId`s
- Track and validate referrals to prevent abuse
- Gracefully handle expirations in your activity for any custom links that are limited time but still live off-platform.

#### User Experience

![custom-link-embed](images/activities/custom-link-embed.png)

Users will see an embed with your information displayed. Clicking "Play" opens the activity and passes through the `custom_id` you've set. A `referrer_id` will be present for links shared on Discord.

---

### Generating a Custom Link Within Your Activity

This guide covers creating a customizable [Incentivized Link](/docs/activities/development-guides#prompting-users-to-share-incentivized-links) within your activity, and using the `shareLink` API to share the link.

* Allows you to customize the way the link is presented to users via the embed
* Can be generated on-demand within your activity
* Ephemeral, 30 day TTL
* Does not show up in the developer portal

#### Generating a Link

```
// Convert an image array buffer to base64 string
const image = base64EncodedImage;

// Generate the quick activity link
const linkIdResponse = await fetch(`${env.discordAPI}/applications/${env.applicationId}/quick-links/`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
  },
  body: {
    custom_id: 'user_123/game_456'
    description: 'I just beat level 10 with a perfect score',
    title: 'Check out my high score!',
    image,
  }
});
const {link_id} = await linkIdResponse.json();

// Open the Share modal with the generated link
const {success} = await discordSdk.commands.shareLink({
  linkId: link_id
});
success ? console.log('User shared link!') : console.log('User did not share link!');
```

### Preventing unwanted activity sessions

Activities are surfaced through iframes in the Discord app. The activity website itself is publicly reachable at `<application_id>.discordsays.com`. Activities will expect to be able to communicate with Discord's web or mobile client via the Discord SDK's RPC protocol. If a user loads the activity's website in a normal browser, the Discord RPC server will not be present, and the activity will likely fail in some way.

It is theoretically possible for a malicious client to mock Discord's RPC protocol or load one activity website when launching another. Because the activity is loaded inside Discord, the RPC protocol is active, and the activity is none the wiser.

To enable an activity to "lock down" activity access, we encourage utilizing the `get_activity_instance` API, found at `discord.com/api/applications/<application_id>/activity-instances/<instance_id>'`. The route requires a Bot token of the application. It returns a serialized active activity instance for the given application, if found, otherwise it returns a 404. Here are two example responses:

```javascript
curl https://discord.com/api/applications/1215413995645968394/activity-instances/i-1234567890-gc-912952092627435520-912954213460484116 -H 'Authorization: Bot <bot token>'
{"message": "404: Not Found", "code": 0}

curl https://discord.com/api/applications/1215413995645968394/activity-instances/i-1276580072400224306-gc-912952092627435520-912954213460484116 -H 'Authorization: Bot <bot token>'
{"application_id":"1215413995645968394","instance_id":"i-1276580072400224306-gc-912952092627435520-912954213460484116","launch_id":"1276580072400224306","location":{"id":"gc-912952092627435520-912954213460484116","kind":"gc","channel_id":"912954213460484116","guild_id":"912952092627435520"},"users":["205519959982473217"]}
```

With this API, the activity's backend can verify that a client is in fact in an instance of that activity before allowing the client to participate in any meaningful gameplay. How an activity implements "session verification" is left to the developer's discretion. The solution can be as granular as gating specific features or as binary as not returning the activity HTML except for valid sessions.

In the below flow diagram, we show how the server can deliver the activity website, only for valid users in a valid activity instance:
![application-test-mode-prod](images/activities/activity-instance-validation.jpg)

### Setting Up Activity Metadata

The Activity Shelf is where users can see what Activities can be played. It has various metadata and art assets that can be configured.

To update your app's metadata in the Discord Developer Portal, navigate to the `Settings -> General Information` tab of your app.

- **Application Name:** The publicly visible name of your app.
- **Application Icon:** The publicly visible icon for your app.
- **Application Description:** The application description is shown in the view of the Activity Shelf Item.
- **Max Participants:** The max participants indicate the maximum number of players for your application.
  - Max Participants is displayed above the name in the 1-up view: `Up to X participants`.
  - Leaving this field empty defaults to `Unlimited participants`.
  - Max Participants is also displayed under the name in the 2-up view.

:::info
An app can have a different application name and avatar from the application's bot username and avatar. Both sets of metadata are public-facing and may be visible in various situations when a user interacts with your app. You can view your bot's username on the `Settings -> Bot` tab.
:::

---

### Setting Up Activity Art Assets

The Activity Shelf is where users can see what Activities can be played. It has various metadata and art assets that can be configured.

To update your app's embedded-specific art assets in the Discord Developer Portal, navigate to the `Activities -> Art Assets` tab of your app.

### Embedded Background

Used as a background overlay in Grid view. Artwork should be clustered around the edges of the image leaving space in the center of the image so the UI does not clash with it.

#### Specifications
- 16:9 aspect ratio
- At least 1024 pixels wide

### Cover Art

Used as the main image in the Activity Shelf. It is suggested that this image contain the title and some art in the background.

#### Specifications:
- Image can be displayed at both 16:9 and 13:11 aspect ratios
- At least 1024 pixels wide


### App Tile

There are two views of an application tile. The regular size tile (2-up tile) and the larger "featured" application tile (1-up tile).

### Video Preview

Hovering over the cover image should start playing a preview video of the Application. The preview videos should be no more than 10 seconds long. If no video is provided, nothing will happen as you hover over the application.

#### Specifications: 640 x 360, mp4 format, under 10 seconds long, under 1 MB in size

---

### Cache Busting

All assets loaded by your application will respect [cache headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control). One exception is that Discord's application proxy will remove any cache headers for assets whose `content-type` headers include `text/html`. For all non-`text/html` content that your application plans to serve, be sure your application has a cache-busting strategy. This is often built into build processes. If your application has a static filename for its javascript or css, please be sure to implement cache busting techniques, for example [webpack enables creating a content hash and manifest](https://webpack.js.org/guides/caching/) as a part of the build process.

----

### Handling Rate Limits

Be sure network requests made by your application's client and server will be able to respect Discord API's rate limiting [as described here](/docs/topics/rate-limits).

See [this implementation in the Activity Starter project](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk-examples/blob/main/discord-activity-starter/packages/server/src/utils.ts) for an example of how to respect the `retry_after` header when you receive a 429 error.

### Static IP Addresses

If your application's server is utilizing a dynamically assigned IP address (this is standard for cloud functions), there is a non-zero chance that you will inherit from a previous bad actor an IP address which has been banned by Cloudflare. In this scenario any egress traffic from the IP address directed towards Discord's API will be banned for up-to an hour. The best way to mitigate this situation is to set up a static IP address for all of your application server's egress traffic to be routed through.

### Backward Compatibility

#### New Commands

When new commands become available in the embedded-app-sdk, those commands won't be supported by all Discord app versions. The new command will typically only be supported by newer Discord app versions. When an application tries to use a new command with an old Discord app version that doesn't support the command, the Discord app will respond with error code `INVALID_COMMAND` which the application can handle like this:

```javascript
try {
  const {permissions} = await discordSdk.commands.getChannelPermissions();

  // check permissions
  ...
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code == RPCErrorCodes.INVALID_COMMAND) {
    // This is an expected error. The Discord client doesn't support this command
    ...
  } else {
    // Unexpected error
    ...
  }
}
```
