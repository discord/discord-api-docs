### The channel is your canvas

Activities are multiplayer games and social experiences in Discord. Under the hood, an Activity is a web application hosted in an iframe within the Discord client. Once a user connects to your Activity, your app can request information using Discord APIs and gateway events to build rich, interactive experiences for your players. 

Whether you're developing a multiplayer game, a new social experience, or another creative idea, your Activity will be built with the [Embedded App SDK](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_EMBEDDED_APP_SDK). The SDK handles all of the communication between Discord and your app, making it easier to do common tasks like managing connected users, supporting mobile clients, and debugging your Activity.

A few examples of Activities built by Discord are [Putt Party](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5101932219671-Putt-Party-FAQ), [Sketch Heads](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409235005207-Sketch-Heads-FAQ), and [Jamspace Whiteboard](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14042410493847-Jamspace-Whiteboard-FAQ).

The Embedded App SDK uses the RPC API to handle the communication between Discord and your Activity. These guides will help you start building the next big thing on Discord.
