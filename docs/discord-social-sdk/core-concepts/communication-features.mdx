# Communication Features

The Discord Social SDK provides powerful communication features to enhance player interaction in your game.
These features include messaging, voice chat, and in-game lobbies, allowing players to connect seamlessly.

## Limited Access

Without full access, these features are available for development and testing, but they are not suitable for a
production environments as their usage is capped with a rate limit. Please read our
[documentation on rate limits](/docs/topics/rate-limits) to learn more.

## Lobbies & In-Game Chat

A lobby is a virtual space where players can interact through voice and text chat.

- Your game controls lobbies, which can have different membership rules.
- Integrated voice chat allows real-time communication among players in a session.

## Linked Channels

Games can link in-game chat with Discord's server-based text channels in their UI, allowing players to chat in a Discord server without leaving the game.
