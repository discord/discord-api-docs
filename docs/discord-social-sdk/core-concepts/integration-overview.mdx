# Integration Overview

To implement the Discord Social SDK, developers for all platforms will generally follow these steps:

1. Import the SDK
2. Initialize the SDK:
   - Create a [`Client`] instance.
   - Set up event listeners to monitor SDK events and callbacks
3. Authenticate users with flexible account options
   - Link an existing Discord account via OAuth ([`Client::Authorize`]).
   - Create and manage provisional accounts for users who don't have or want a Discord account ([`Client::GetProvisionalToken`]).
4. Implement social features
   - Implement [unified friends list](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/creating-a-unified-friends-list) and [relationships](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/managing-relationships).
   - Use [rich presence](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/setting-rich-presence) for game activity updates.
   - Set up [lobbies](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/managing-lobbies) for multiplayer interaction and [game invites](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/managing-game-invites).
   - Manage [direct message](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/sending-direct-messages), [linked channels](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/creating-a-unified-friends-list), and [voice communication](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/managing-voice-chat).
5. Handle events & API calls:
   - Listen for changes in friend lists, presence updates, and chat messages.
   - Use Discord's APIs to update statuses, send messages, and manage connections.

This guide is a conceptual overview. If you're ready to start building, [follow our step-by-step guide](/docs/discord-social-sdk/getting-started) to set up the SDK in your game engine.
