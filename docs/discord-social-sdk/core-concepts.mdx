# Core Concepts: Discord Social SDK

The Discord Social SDK allows you to build social features into your game, including friend lists, messaging, voice chat, and rich presence. Unlike a traditional SDK with built-in UI components, the Discord Social SDK provides access to raw data, allowing developers to create a fully customized experience that aligns with their game's aesthetic.
