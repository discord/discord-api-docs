# How to Market Your Integration

## Overview

Congrats! We’re so happy you’ve powered your game's social experiences with the Discord Social SDK, and now it’s time to
let your players know about it. This toolkit is meant to provide you with guidelines and best practices to help you have
a strong go-to-market plan to make your players aware of the integration, answer their questions, and use Discord brand
guidelines appropriately.

As the developer, the choice and ownership of marketing your integration with the Discord Social SDK to your players
is yours, but we want to ensure you had a place to start if you needed. As a reminder, you may not make any statement
that suggests a partnership with, sponsorship by, or endorsement by Discord without our prior written approval in each instance.

## Announcement Goals And Messaging

Announcing **Discord Social SDK** features to your players has two goals:

* **For Players:** Drive awareness of how playing with friends is easier by linking your Discord account.
* **For Developer:** Encourage more persistent social interaction between your players.

Player-facing messaging of Discord Social SDK is different from how we frame it to developers, like you. Below are
some key messages you can pull into your announcement materials.

:::info
Our guidance focuses on features that encourage Discord account linking, however, you can still use
this guidance and our brand guidelines for Discord Social SDK features that do not require account linking.
:::

### Product Name
The full product name is "Discord Social SDK". Please use the full name when first mentioning the Discord Social SDK in your announcements. After mentioning it once, you may refer to it as the "SDK".

### Key Message to Players
Link your Discord account and play with friends more easily.

### Key Benefits to Players

1. Find your friends
2. Link your Discord account to see who’s playing and easily join them. From the game, invite your friends to join—even if they’re offline.
3. Stay connected
4. Keep the conversation going by syncing messages and friends lists to Discord

  * When using this splash animation in your video, always include this at the beginning of the video. This splash
  video should never go in the middle or end of your content.
