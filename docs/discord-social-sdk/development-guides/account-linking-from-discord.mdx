title: Account Linking from Discord
description: Adopt the new account linking APIs to allow Discord to show your players entry points for account linking within the Discord client

import PublicClient from "/snippets/discord-social-sdk/callouts/public-client.mdx";
import SupportCallout from "/snippets/discord-social-sdk/callouts/support.mdx";

## Overview

The Discord client contains entry points to encourage users to link their account to your game. This guide explains how to prepare your game for the Discord client's account linking flows.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Read the [Core Concepts](/developers/docs/discord-social-sdk/core-concepts) guide to understand:
  - OAuth2 authentication flow
  - Discord application setup
  - SDK initialization
- Set up your development environment with:
  - Discord application created in the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  - Discord Social SDK downloaded and configured
  - Basic SDK integration working (initialization and connection)

If you haven't completed these prerequisites, we recommend first following the [Getting Started](/developers/docs/discord-social-sdk/getting-started) guide.

## The Account Linking Flows

At this time, Discord provides two different flows for account linking from the client, the connected game flow and the web flow. When a user clicks on one of the entry points within their Discord client, it will choose one of the currently available flows to send the user through. To provide a good user experience, flows are chosen in the following priority order:

- Connected game flow
- Web flow

### Connected Game Flow

This is our prefered account linking flow as we think it provides the best user experience when it's available. The connected game flow will send the user into your game client to begin the account linking flow.

#### Prerequisites

- Upgrade to SDK version 1.6 or higher
- Implement account linking

#### Implementation

Once you have adopted SDK version 1.6 or higher, there will be two new methods on the Client object, [`Client::RegisterAuthorizeRequestCallback`] and [`Client::RemoveAuthorizeRequestCallback`]. These two new methods will allow you to enable and disable this flow while your game is running.

<Warning>
	Before calling [`Client::RegisterAuthorizeRequestCallback`], ensure
	[`Client::SetApplicationId`] has been called. This ensures that your game is
	properly identifying itself to the Discord client and that all requests are
	associated with the correct application.
</Warning>

Calling [`Client::RegisterAuthorizeRequestCallback`] with a callback function will signal to the Discord client that your game is running and able to start the account linking process. You should run this as soon as your game is able to handle an account link, for instance just after your user has logged in or reached the main menu.

When a user clicks one of the account linking entry points in their Discord client, the SDK will run your callback. Treat this as if the user had just clicked one of your in-game account linking buttons and begin the authorization flow right away.

<Info>
	When your game receives this callback, the user is most likely focused on the
	Discord client, not the game client. Make sure to pull focus or otherwise
	alert the user that something is happening in the game. The Discord client
	will notify them to check the game as well, but for a more seamless
	experience, you should pull them back into the game.
</Info>

Calling [`Client::RemoveAuthorizeRequestCallback`] will signal to the Discord client that your game is no longer able to start the account linking process. Call this whenever your game client is entering a state where starting the account linking process wouldn't work, for instance if the player enters a match, logs out, or is in some other full screen flow like a cutscene.

This is all you need to enable the connected game flow, you can test and debug this flow using our new [built-in developer tools](/developers/docs/discord-social-sdk/how-to/debug-log#client-tools) in the Discord client.

```cpp
// If you haven't already
client.SetApplicationId("123456789");

client.RegisterAuthorizeRequestCallback([client, myGameAuthorizationHandler]() {
	// Pull focus into your game using native APIs
	// ...

	// Run your normal authorization flow
	myGameAuthorizationHandler.StartDiscordAccountLink();
});
```

#### Best Practices

When a user clicks the account link button in their Discord client, this is a high intent action. Skip any extra upsells you have until after the user has linked their account, any extra steps added to this linking flow increases the areas where users may drop off. Show them any upsells after they've linked to reaffirm all the new features and any rewards they may have unlocked by linking their account.

Ensure you're enabling and disabling the callback at the appropriate times. If a user clicks an entry point in their Discord client and it launches the account linking flow in the middle of a match, this can interrupt gameplay and pull them out of your intended experience.

Don't worry about checking if the user is already linked, the Discord client will handle hiding the entry point for users that have already linked their accounts. This will keep your implementation simpler and reduce surface for issues.

### Web Flow

The web flow is an alternative to the connected game flow, allowing you to send users to a webpage to begin the account linking process. At this time, this flow is only available to partners.

#### Prerequisites

- Implement the [standard OAuth2 flow](/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) on your website

#### Implemetation

Ensure your webpage meets the following requirements:

- If the user isn't signed in to their game account, it should prompt them to sign in and then take them immediately back to the authorization flow.
- The authorization should request the same scopes that you request in your game
- After authorization is complete, the token should be saved to the user's account the same way you would during in-game authorization so that it's ready the next time the user launches their game
- If the user is currently in game, send an update to their client with the token and call [`Client::UpdateToken`] to sign them in right away without needing to restart their game

## Next Steps

Now that you've successfully implemented account linking with Discord, you can integrate more social features into your game.
