# Using Provisional Accounts

## Overview

Provisional accounts let players use Social SDK features in your game without linking a Discord account so all players can have a consistent gameplay experience.

With provisional accounts, players can:

- Add friends and communicate with other players
- Join voice chats in game lobbies
- Send direct messages to other players
- Appear in friends lists and game lobbies

All of this works seamlessly whether your players have Discord accounts or not.

This guide will show you how to:

1. Set up provisional accounts for your game
2. Create and manage provisional accounts
3. Handle account merging when users want to upgrade to full Discord

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A basic understanding of how the SDK works from the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/discord-social-sdk/getting-started)
- An external authentication provider set up for your game

---

## What Are Provisional Accounts?

Think of provisional accounts as temporary Discord accounts that:

- Work only with your game
- Can be upgraded to full Discord accounts later
- Persist between game sessions
- Use your game's authentication system

With provisional accounts, players can use Discord features like chat and voice and interact with game friends without creating a full Discord account. They are "placeholder" Discord accounts for the user that your game owns and manages.

For existing Discord users who have added a provisional account as a game friend, the provisional account will appear in their friend list, allowing you to send direct messages and interact with them for text and voice in lobbies.

### How It Works

1. Your game authenticates players using your existing system (Steam, Epic, etc.)
2. Discord creates temporary accounts linked to those identities
3. Players can use Discord features immediately
4. Players can optionally upgrade to full Discord accounts later
5. All friends and chat history transfer when upgrading

### Benefits

- Instant Access: Players can use social features immediately
- Seamless Experience: Works the same for all players
- Easy Upgrade Path: Simple conversion to full Discord accounts
- Data Persistence: Friends and history are preserved
- Cross-Platform: Works on all supported platforms

---

## Configuring Your Identity Provider

Open the Discord app for your game in the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Find the `External Auth` page under the `Discord Social SDK` section in the sidebar.

Click on `Add Auth Provider` and choose the type of provider you're using (Steam, OIDC, etc.). Fill in the required details for your provider.

We currently support the following provider types:

- OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Steam Session Tickets
- Epic Online Services (EOS)
- Unity

## Implementing Provisional Accounts

### Provisional Account Authentication for Public Clients

<PublicClient />

If you have `Public Client` enabled on your Discord app, you can use the following code to authenticate your players with the external provider.

```cpp
// filepath: your_game/auth_manager.cpp
void AuthenticateUser(std::shared_ptr<discordpp::Client> client) {
    // Get your external auth token (Steam, OIDC, etc.)
    std::string externalToken = GetExternalAuthToken();
    
    // Get provisional token from Discord
    client->GetProvisionalToken(DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID, 
        discordpp::AuthenticationExternalAuthType::OIDC, 
        externalToken,
        [client](discordpp::ClientResult result, std::string accessToken, std::string refreshToken, discordpp::AuthorizationTokenType tokenType, int32_t expiresIn, std::string scope) {
        if (result.Successful()) {
            std::cout << "🔓 Provisional token received! Establishing connection...\n";
            client->UpdateToken(discordpp::AuthorizationTokenType::Bearer, accessToken, [client](discordpp::ClientResult result) {
                client->Connect();
            });
        } else {
            std::cerr << "❌ Provisional token request failed: " << result.Error() << std::endl;
        }
    });
}
```


#### Provisional Account Access Tokens

This function generates a Discord access token. You pass in the user's identity, and it generates a new Discord account tied to that identity. There are multiple ways of specifying that identity, including using Steam/Epic services or your own identity system.

The callback function will be invoked with an access token that expires in 1 hour. Refresh tokens are not supported for provisional accounts, so that will be an empty string. When the old one expires, you must call this function again to get a new access token.

You can use [`Client::SetTokenExpirationCallback`] to receive a callback when the current token is about to expire or expires.

:::info
When the token expires, the SDK will still receive updates, such as new messages sent in a lobby, and any voice calls will continue to be active. However, any new actions, such as sending a message or adding a friend, will fail. You can get a new token and pass it to UpdateToken without interrupting the user's experience.
:::

#### Provisional Account Access Token Storage

It is suggested that these provisional tokens are not stored and instead invoke this function each time the game is launched and when these tokens are about to expire. However, should you choose to store it, it is recommended that these provisional account tokens be differentiated from "full" Discord account tokens.

### Provisional Account Authentication for Servers

If you are not using the [`Client::GetProvisionalToken`] method, you'll need to make a request to the Discord API provisional account token endpoint.

---

## Setting Display Names

Using these credentials, we'll create a limited Discord account just for your game and try to set the username for you according to the following:

- For OIDC, a provisional account's display name will be the value of the `preferred_username` claim, if specified in
  the ID token. This field is optional and should be between 1 and 32 characters. If not specified, the user's display
  name will default to the user's unique username, which Discord generates on creation.
- For [Steam session tickets](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/auth), the display name of the user's Steam
  account is used as the provisional account's display name.
- For [EOS Auth](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-account-services/auth/auth-interface) Access Tokens or ID Tokens,
  the name of the user's Epic account is used as the provisional account's display name. EOS Connect ID Tokens do
  not expose any username, and thus the game will need to configure the display name with
  [`Client::UpdateProvisionalAccountDisplayName`].
- For [Unity Services ID Tokens](https://services.docs.unity.com/docs/client-auth/),
  the display name of the user's Unity Player Account is used as the provisional account's display name.

If you'd like to set the display name for a provisional account, you can use the [`Client::UpdateProvisionalAccountDisplayName`] method.

```cpp
client->UpdateProvisionalAccountDisplayName("CoolPlayer123", [](discordpp::ClientResult result) {
    if (!result.Successful()) {
      std::cout << "✅ Display name updated\n";
    }
  }
);
```

## Merging Provisional Accounts

When a player wants to convert their provisional acount to a full Discord account.

### Merging Provisional Accounts for Public Clients

<PublicClient />

The easiest way to merge accounts is to leverage the [`Client::GetTokenFromProvisionalMerge`] (Desktop & Mobile) or [`Client::GetTokenFromDeviceProvisionalMerge`] (Console) method, which will handle the entire process for you. You'll want to first enable Public Client on your Discord application's OAuth2 tab on the Discord developer portal. You can then leverage the [`Client::GetTokenFromProvisionalMerge`] or [`Client::GetTokenFromDeviceProvisionalMerge`] method using just the client.

This function should be used with the Client::Authorize function whenever a user with a provisional account wants to link to an existing Discord account or "upgrade" their provisional account into a "full" Discord account.

In this case, data from the provisional account should be "migrated" to the Discord account, a process we call "account merging". Specifically, relationships, DMs, and lobby memberships are transferred to the Discord account.

The provisional account will be deleted once this merging process is completed. If the user unlinks later, a new provisional account with a new unique ID is created.

The account merging process starts like the normal login flow, invoking the [`Client::Authorize`] method to get an authorization code back. Instead of calling `GetToken`, call this function and pass on the provisional user's identity.

Discord can then find the provisional account with that identity and the new Discord account and merge any data as necessary.

See the documentation for [`Client::GetToken`] for more details on the callback. Note that the callback will be invoked when the token exchange is complete, but merging accounts happens asynchronously and will not be complete yet.

```cpp
// Create a code verifier and challenge if using GetToken
auto codeVerifier = client->CreateAuthorizationCodeVerifier();
discordpp::AuthorizationArgs args{};
args.SetClientId(YOUR_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID);
args.SetScopes(discordpp::Client::GetDefaultPresenceScopes());
args.SetCodeChallenge(codeVerifier.Challenge());

client->Authorize(args, [client, codeVerifier](discordpp::ClientResult result, std::string code, std::string redirectUri) {
  if (!result.Successful()) {
    std::cerr << "❌ Authorization Error: " << result.Error() << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "✅ Authorization successful! Next step: GetTokenFromProvisionalMerge \n";
    
    // Retrieve your external auth token
    std::string externalAuthToken = GetExternalAuthToken();

    client->GetTokenFromProvisionalMerge(YOUR_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID, code, codeVerifier, redirectUri, discordpp::AuthenticationExternalAuthType::OIDC, externalAuthToken,[client](
      discordpp::ClientResult result,
      std::string accessToken,
      std::string refreshToken,
      discordpp::AuthorizationTokenType tokenType,
      int32_t expiresIn,
      std::string scope) {
        if (result.Successful()) {
          std::cout << "🔓 Token received! Establishing connection...\n";
          client->UpdateToken(discordpp::AuthorizationTokenType::Bearer, accessToken, [client](discordpp::ClientResult result) {
            client->Connect();
          });
        } else {
          std::cerr << "❌ Token request failed: " << result.Error() << std::endl;
        }
    });

  }
});
```

You'll want to use your game backend for the merge operation if you have one.

### Merging Provisional Accounts for Servers

#### Desktop & Mobile

If you are not using the [`Client::GetTokenFromProvisionalMerge`] or [`Client::GetTokenFromDeviceProvisionalMerge`] method, you'll need to make a request to our API's OAuth2 token endpoint from your server.

```python
import requests
 
API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = '332269999912132097'
CLIENT_SECRET = '937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire'
EXTERNAL_AUTH_TYPE = 'OIDC'
 
def exchange_code_with_merge(code, redirect_uri, external_auth_token):
  data = {
    'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
    'code': code,
    'redirect_uri': redirect_uri,
    'external_auth_type': EXTERNAL_AUTH_TYPE,
    'external_auth_token': external_auth_token
  }
  headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  }
  r = requests.post('%s/oauth2/token' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers, auth=(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))
  r.raise_for_status()
  return r.json()
```

#### Console

```python
import requests
 
API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = '332269999912132097'
CLIENT_SECRET = '937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire'
EXTERNAL_AUTH_TYPE = 'OIDC'
 
def exchange_device_code_with_merge(device_code):
  data = {
    'grant_type': 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code',
    'device_code': device_code,
    'external_auth_type': EXTERNAL_AUTH_TYPE,
    'external_auth_token': external_auth_token
  }
  headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  }
  r = requests.post('%s/oauth2/token' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers, auth=(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))
  r.raise_for_status()
  return r.json()
```

#### Merge Request Response

```python
{
  "access_token": "<access token>",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 604800,
  "refresh_token": "<refresh token>",
  "scope": "sdk.social_layer"
}
```

## Unmerging Provisional Accounts

When a player wants to unlink their Discord account from their provisional account, there are two options.

1. The user can unmerge their account from the Discord client.
2. A developer can unmerge the account using the unmerge endpoint on the Discord API.

### Discord Users

Users can unmerge their account by removing access to your application on their Discord `User Settings -> Authorized Apps` page.

### Unmerging using the unmerge endpoint

A developer can unmerge a user's account by sending a request to the unmerge endpoint on the Discord API.


```python
import requests
 
API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = '332269999912132097'
CLIENT_SECRET = '937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire'
EXTERNAL_AUTH_TYPE = 'OIDC'
 
def unmerge_provisional_account(external_auth_token):
  data = {
    'client_id': CLIENT_ID,
    'client_secret': CLIENT_SECRET,
    'external_auth_type': EXTERNAL_AUTH_TYPE,
    'external_auth_token': external_auth_token
  }
  r = requests.post('%s/partner-sdk/provisional-accounts/unmerge' % API_ENDPOINT, json=data, headers=headers)
  r.raise_for_status()
```
