# Creating a Unified Friends List

## Overview

A unified friends list combines both Discord and game-specific relationships in one view. This guide will show you how to:
- Fetch all relationship data
- Filter and organize relationships
- Display online status
- Handle different relationship types

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Set up the Discord Social SDK with [Getting Started Guide](/docs/discord-social-sdk/getting-started)
- Authenticated your users with [Development Guide: Account Linking](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/account-linking-with-discord)
- Understanding of relationship types with [Development Guide: Managing Relationships in Your Game](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/managing-relationships)

### Implementing a Unified Friends List

The Discord friend list is ultimately constructed from two entities: Relationships, and Users. You can query Relationships API to find everyone a user is a friend with, and the Users API to find the necessary extra information for rendering the list, such as whether they are online or not.

### Relationships

[Relationships](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/managing-relationships) are how Discord models friends, friend requests, and more. All relationships for the current user are loaded when the Client connects. Each relationship has a target user id, and a type, such as `Friend`, `PendingOutgoing`, or `Blocked`. The set of all relationships can be queried with [`Client::GetRelationships`].

To allow users to manage their relationships in your game, you should provide a way to accept or reject friend requests, block users, and manage pending requests. See [Development Guide: Managing Relationships in Your Game](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/managing-relationships) for implementation details.

### Users

Users are the Discord users that are part of the relationships. The SDK provides a way to fetch a user by their ID, and the user object contains information such as their username, display name, avatar, and more.

### User Status & Rich Presence

Presence is how Discord stores whether a user is currently online or not, as well as what activities they are currently doing (such as playing a game). The SDK gives you access to two types of status:

- Online Status: Online, Offline, Idle, etc.
- Rich Presence: Any activities associated with the current game (or application in Discord parlance).  

> info
The SDK will only display activities associated with the current game, meaning you will not be able to see other game activities in Rich Presence, even if you can see them in the Discord client.

See our [Design Guidelines: Status & Rich Presence](/docs/discord-social-sdk/design-guidelines_STATUS_RICH_PRESENCE) for best practices on displaying presence information.

Let's combine  to create a unified friends list.

---

## Step 1: Fetch Relationships

First, let's create a function to see what kind of relationships and information we have to work with:

```cpp
void DisplayFriendsList(discordpp::Client& client) {
    std::vector<std::string> relationships{};
    for (auto& relationship: client.GetRelationships()) {
        auto user = relationship.User();
        if (!user) {
            continue;
        }
    
        std::string str{};
        // Identifying information about the user:
        str += " DiscordName: " + user->DisplayName();
        str += " DiscordId: " + std::to_string(user->Id());
        // Provisional users don't have a Discord icon shown next to them:
        str += " IsProvisional: " + std::to_string(user->IsProvisional());
        // Whether the relationship is for a friend, a friend request, or because the user is blocked:
        // For a friends list you'll want to filter out blocked users
        // And likely display friend requests in a different section
        str += " DiscordRelationshipType: " + std::string(discordpp::EnumToString(relationship.DiscordRelationshipType()));
        str += " GameRelationshipType: " + std::string(discordpp::EnumToString(relationship.GameRelationshipType()));
        // Whether the user is online/offline/etc:
        str += " IsOnlineAnywhere: " + std::to_string(user->Status() != discordpp::StatusType::Offline);
        str += " IsOnlineInGame: " + std::to_string(user->GameActivity() != std::nullopt);
        relationships.push_back(str);
    }
    
    std::sort(relationships.begin(), relationships.end());
    for (auto str : relationships) {
        printf("%s\n", str.c_str());
    }
}
```

We will want to call this function when the client is ready, so let's add it to our ready callback:

```cpp
// Set up status callback to monitor client connection
client->SetStatusChangedCallback([client](discordpp::Client::Status status, discordpp::Client::Error error, int32_t errorDetail) {
    std::cout << "🔄 Status changed: " << discordpp::Client::StatusToString(status) << std::endl;

    if (status == discordpp::Client::Status::Ready) {
        std::cout << "✅ Client is ready! You can now call SDK functions.\n";
        std::cout << "👥 Friends Count: " << client->GetRelationships().size() << std::endl;
        
        SetRichPresence(*client);
        DisplayFriendsList(*client);

    } else if (error != discordpp::Client::Error::None) {
        std::cerr << "❌ Connection Error: " << discordpp::Client::ErrorToString(error) << " - Details: " << errorDetail << std::endl;
    }
});
```

This will output the raw relationship data to the console. You can use this information to filter, organize and build a friends list that fits your game's design aesthetic.

---

## Step 2: Organize Relationships

Based on our design guidelines for a [Unified Friends List](/docs/discord-social-sdk/design-guidelines_UNIFIED_FRIENDS_LIST), you should separate the player's friends list into three sections: `Online - GameTitle`, `Online - Elsewhere`, and `Offline`. 

Because we are building a text console application, we will use emojis to represent the status of each friend but you can use your own design elements to convey status and presence in your game.

Let's update our `DisplayFriendsList` function to reflect our three sections and categorize friends based on their status:

- We will create three vectors to store the friends in each category.
- We will filter out pending friends and blocked users.
- We will add indicators for Discord friends, game friends, and provisional users.
- We will categorize friends based on their game and presence status.
- We will sort each category alphabetically.
- We will display each category separately.

> info
> This example is for reference only. Please make sure you use efficient data structures and cache data when appropriate to avoid performance issues in your game.

```cpp
void DisplayFriendsList(discordpp::Client& client) {
    // Create vectors for each section
    std::vector<std::string> inGame;
    std::vector<std::string> online;
    std::vector<std::string> offline;
    
    for (auto& relationship : client.GetRelationships()) {
        auto user = relationship.User();
        if (!user) {
            continue;
        }

        // Filter out pending friends and blocked users
        // You can display friend requests and blocked users in a different view to allow players to manage them in your game
        if (relationship.DiscordRelationshipType() != discordpp::RelationshipType::Friend) {
            continue;
        }
 
        std::string str;
        str += user->DisplayName();

        // Add Discord friend indicator
        // In a real game, please use the official Discord logo available in our design guidelines
        if (relationship.DiscordRelationshipType() == discordpp::RelationshipType::Friend) {
            str += " 👾";
        }

        // Add game friend indicator
        if (relationship.GameRelationshipType() == discordpp::RelationshipType::Friend) {
            str += " 🎮";
        }

        // Add provisional indicator
        if (user->IsProvisional()) {
            str += " (Provisional)";
        }

        // Categorize based on status
        if (user->Status() != discordpp::StatusType::Offline) {
            // online
            online.push_back("🟢 " + str);
        } else {
            // offline
            offline.push_back("⚫ " + str);
        } 
    }
    
    // Sort each category
    std::sort(inGame.begin(), inGame.end());
    std::sort(online.begin(), online.end());
    std::sort(offline.begin(), offline.end());
    
    // Display "Online - GameTitle" Friends
    std::cout << "\n=== Online - GameTitle (" << inGame.size() << ") ===\n";
    for (const auto& str : inGame) {
        std::cout << str << "\n";
    }
    
    // Display "Online - Elsewhere" Friends
    std::cout << "\n=== Online - Elsewhere (" << online.size() << ") ===\n";
    for (const auto& str : online) {
        std::cout << str << "\n";
    }
    
    // Display "Offline" Friends
    std::cout << "\n=== Offline (" << offline.size() << ") ===\n";
    for (const auto& str : offline) {
        std::cout << str << "\n";
    }
}
```

If we build and run our application, we should now see a list of friends separated into three categories: `Online - GameTitle`, `Online - Elsewhere`, and `Offline`.

## Step 3: Monitor Changes in Relationships

Let's setup two callbacks to handle relationship updates.

### Relationship Created Callback

This can happen when a user sends or accepts a friend invite, or blocks a user.

```cpp
client->SetRelationshipCreatedCallback([&client](uint64_t userId, bool isDiscordRelationshipUpdate) {
    std::cout << "🤝 Relationship created: " << userId << std::endl;
    DisplayFriendsList(*client);
}); 
```

### Relationship Deleted Callback

This can happen when a user rejects a friend request or removes a friend.

```cpp
client->SetRelationshipDeletedCallback([&client](uint64_t userId, bool isDiscordRelationshipUpdate) {
    std::cout << "🔥 Relationship deleted: " << userId << std::endl;
    DisplayFriendsList(*client);
});
```

Now your friends list will automatically update when relationships change, such as when you add a new friend, accept a friend request, or block a user.

> warn
> Note: Our example will rebuild the friends list from scratch every time a relationship changes. For performance reasons, you will want to update only the changed relationships.

## Step 4: Monitor Changes to Users 

To monitor for user changes, we're going using the [`Client::SetUserUpdatedCallback`] function. 

This callback will be triggered whenever a user's info is updated, such as name or presence changes (when they go online, offline, or start playing your game).

```cpp
client->SetUserUpdatedCallback([&client](uint64_t userId) {
    std::cout << "👤 User updated: " << userId << std::endl;
    DisplayFriendsList(*client);
});
```

Now your friends list will automatically update when the presence of a friend changes, such as when they go online, offline or start playing your game.

> warn
> Note: Our example will rebuild the friends list from scratch every time a relationship changes. For performance reasons, you will want to update only the user or relationship that changed.
