## Overview

This guide will help you understand how to install debugging symbols and handle logging to assist in building your Discord Social SDK integration.

## Debugging

Debugging symbols are hosted at https://storage.googleapis.com/discord-public-symbols. If using Visual Studio, you can add this link to the pdb locations under `Tools > Options > Debugging > Symbols`. 

> info
> Note: You won't be able to browse files using that link, but that's ok. Individual files are accessible under the domain, and the URL functions properly as a symbol server, so it works in Visual Studio.

## Logging

You can access Discord's logs with [`Client::AddLogCallback`]. We recommend writing logs to a file and, during testing, including verbose logs. The [`Client::SetLogDir`] function will write the SDK's logs to that directory if set. 

```cpp
client->AddLogCallback([](auto message, auto severity) {
  std::cout << "[" << EnumToString(severity) << "] " << message << std::endl;
}, discordpp::LoggingSeverity::Info);
```

> info
> Audio logs are not included in the logs by default. We will update this guide to include audio logs in the future.
