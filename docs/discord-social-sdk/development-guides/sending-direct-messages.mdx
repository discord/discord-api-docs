## Overview

Direct Messages (DMs) allow players to communicate privately. This guide will show you how to:

- Send text messages between users
- Handle displaying messages in your game

### Types of Chat Messages

The Discord Social SDK SDK supports two types of chat:

- [Direct messages (DMs) between two users](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/sending-direct-messages#sending-a-direct-message-to-a-user)
- [Chat messages within a lobby](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/managing-lobbies#sending-messages-to-a-lobby)

The SDK receives messages in the following channel types:

- DM
- Ephemeral DM
- Lobby

Let's get started with sending a direct message to another user.

## Sending a Direct Message to a User

:::info
While the SDK allows you to send messages on behalf of a user, you must only do so in response to a user action. You should never automatically send messages.
:::

Here's how to send a direct message. You'll need the recipient's Discord ID and the message you want to send.

```cpp
std::string message = "ready to queue?";
uint64_t recipientId = 1234567890; // The recipient's Discord ID

client->SendUserMessage(recipientId, message, [](auto result, uint64_t messageId) {
  if (result.Successful()) {
    std::cout << "✅ Message sent successfully\n";
  } else {
    std::cout << "❌ Failed to send message: " << result.Error() << "\n";
  }
});
```

### Syncing Messages with Discord

In some situations, messages from your game with the Social SDK will also appear in Discord. This will happen for:

- 1 on 1 chat when at least one of the users is a full Discord user
- Lobby chat when the lobby is [linked to a Discord channel](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/linked-channels)
- The message must have been sent by a user who is not banned on Discord.

When messaging between provisional accounts or non-friends, channel ID and recipient ID is set to the other user's ID. These messages are sent ephemerally and do not persist within a channel. Because of that, you will not be able to resolve a [`ChannelHandle`] for them.

---

## Receiving and Rendering Messages

When a user sends a message, the SDK can respond to new messages by registering [`Client::SetMessageCreatedCallback`]. You can access the message content and sender's ID in your callback from the [`MessageHandle`] object.

The [`MessageHandle`] represents a single message received by the SDK.

```cpp
client->SetMessageCreatedCallback([&client](uint64_t messageId) {
  if (auto message = client->GetMessageHandle(messageId)) {
    std::cout << "New message from " << message->AuthorId() << ": " << message->Content() << "\n";
  }
});
```

There are also callbacks for when a message is updated or deleted. Register these callbacks with [`Client::SetMessageUpdatedCallback`] and [`Client::SetMessageDeletedCallback`].

### Suppressing Double Notifications

Suppose the user has the Discord desktop application open on the same machine as the game. In that case, they will hear notifications from the Discord application, even though they can see those messages in-game. So to avoid double-notifying users, you should call [`Client::SetShowingChat`] whenever the chat is shown or hidden to suppress those duplicate notifications.

### Legal Disclosure Message Type

As a convenience for game developers, the first time a user sends a message in the game, that message shows up on the Discord client. The SDK will inject a "fake" message into the chat that contains a basic English explanation of what is happening to the user. You can identify these messages with the [`MessageHandle::DisclosureType`] method. We encourage you to customize the rendering of these messages, possibly changing the wording, translating them, and making them look more "official". You can choose to avoid rendering these as well.

### Message History

The SDK keeps the 25 most recent messages in each channel in memory, but it cannot access any historical messages sent before the SDK was connected. A [`MessageHandle`] will keep working even after the SDK has discarded the message for being too old. You just won't be able to create new [`MessageHandle`] objects for that message.

### Working with Unrenderable Content

Messages sent on Discord can contain content that may not be renderable in-game, such as images, videos, embeds, polls, and more. The game isn't expected to render these. Instead, it should show a notice so the user knows there is more content and a way to view it on Discord. The [`MessageHandle::AdditionalContent`] method will contain data about the non-text content in this message.

You can use this metadata to render a placeholder message for players and can link out to Discord using [`Client::CanOpenMessageInDiscord`] and [`Client::OpenMessageInDiscord`].

There is also more information about [messages in the Discord API](/docs/resources/message) documentation.

## In-Game Direct Message Settings

The Discord client provides a settings screen for users to be able to control who can DM them in-game via the
Social SDK.

![Discord content and social - Connected game settings](images/social-sdk/development-guides/discord-game-dm-settings.png)

You cannot control these settings directly with the Social SDK. However, you can call
[`Client::OpenConnectedGamesSettingsInDiscord`], which opens the Connected Games settings in the Discord client,
where users can manage their direct messaging settings related to games using the Discord Social SDK.

If the client isn't connected or the user is a provisional account, this function does nothing.

It is always a no-op for console platforms.
