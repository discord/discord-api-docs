## Overview
This guide explains how to authenticate users with their existing Discord accounts via OAuth2, enabling seamless login and access to Discord features.

### Flexible Account Options
If a player does not have a Discord account, you can use the SDK to [create a provisional account](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/using-provisional-accounts) instead so that they can still access your game's features.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Read the [Core Concepts](/docs/discord-social-sdk/core-concepts) guide to understand:
  - OAuth2 authentication flow
  - Discord application setup
  - SDK initialization
- Set up your development environment with:
  - Discord application created in the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  - Discord Social SDK downloaded and configured
  - Basic SDK integration working (initialization and connection)

If you haven't completed these prerequisites, we recommend first following the [Getting Started](/docs/discord-social-sdk/getting-started) guide.

## Our Authentication Flow

OAuth2 is the standard authentication flow that allows users to sign in using their Discord account. The process follows these steps:

1. [Request authorization](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/account-linking-with-discord#step-1-request-authorization): Your game sends an authentication request to Discord.
2. [User Approval](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/account-linking-with-discord#step-2-user-approval): The user approves the request, granting access to your application.
3. [Receive Authorization Code](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/account-linking-with-discord#step-3-receiving-the-authorization-code): After approval, Discord redirects the user to your app with an authorization code.
4. [Exchange for Tokens](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/account-linking-with-discord#step-4-exchanging-the-authorization-code-for-an-access-token): The authorization code is exchanged for:
   - Access Token, which is valid for ~7 days
   - Refresh Token, used to obtain a new access token

### OAuth2 using the Discord Social SDK

- If the Discord client has [overlay support](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217659737-Game-Overlay-101) (Windows only), the OAuth2 login modal appears in your game instead of opening a browser.
- The SDK automatically handles redirects, simplifying the authentication flow.
- Some security measures, such as CSRF protection, are built-in, but you should always follow best practices to secure your app.

## Requesting Access Tokens

### Step 0: Configure OAuth2 Redirects
For OAuth2 to work correctly, you must **register the correct redirect URIs** for your app in the **Discord Developer Portal**.

| Platform    | Redirect URI                                                                               |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Desktop** | `http://127.0.0.1/callback`                                                                |
| **Mobile**  | `discord-APP_ID:/authorize/callback` _(replace `APP_ID` with your Discord application ID)_ |

### Step 1: Request Authorization 

The SDK provides helper methods to simplify OAuth2 login.

Use the [`Client::Authorize`] method to initiate authorization and allow the user to approve access.

#### Authorization Scopes

One of the required arguments to [`Client::Authorize`] is scopes, which is the set of permissions that you are requesting. We recommend using [`Client::GetDefaultPresenceScopes`], but you can choose whatever scopes you need.

#### Authorization Code Verifier

If you are using [`Client::GetToken`] in [Step 4](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/account-linking-with-discord#step-4-exchanging-the-authorization-code-for-an-access-token), you will need to specify a "code challenge" and "code verifier" in your requests. We'll spare you the boring details of how that works (woo… crypto), as we've made a simple function to create these for you, [`Client::CreateAuthorizationCodeVerifier`], which you can use to generate the code challenge and verifier.

```cpp
// Create a code verifier and challenge if using GetToken
auto codeVerifier = client->CreateAuthorizationCodeVerifier();
discordpp::AuthorizationArgs args{};
args.SetClientId(YOUR_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID);
args.SetScopes(discordpp::Client::GetDefaultPresenceScopes());
args.SetCodeChallenge(codeVerifier.Challenge());

client->Authorize(args, [client, codeVerifier](discordpp::ClientResult result, std::string code, std::string redirectUri) {
  if (!result.Successful()) {
    std::cerr << "❌ Authorization Error: " << result.Error() << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "✅ Authorization successful! Next step: exchange code for an access token \n";
  }
});
```

### Step 2: User Approval

After calling [`Client::Authorize`], the SDK will open a browser window, Discord client, or an in-game overlay to prompt the user to approve the request.

### Step 3: Receiving the Authorization Code

Once the user approves the request from Step 2, Discord will redirect the user back to your app with an authorization code that you can use to exchange for an access token.

### Step 4: Exchanging the Authorization Code for an Access Token

#### Token Exchange for Public Clients

<PublicClient />

If your app does not have a backend server, enable `Public Client` in the Discord Developer Portal and use [`Client::GetToken`] to automatically exchange the authorization code for a token.

We will also need the code verifier used to generate the code challenge in Step 1.

```cpp
client->GetToken(YOUR_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID, code, codeVerifier.Verifier(), redirectUri,
  [client](discordpp::ClientResult result,
    std::string accessToken,
    std::string refreshToken,
    discordpp::AuthorizationTokenType tokenType,
    int32_t expiresIn,
    std::string scope) {
    std::cout << "🔓 Access token received! Establishing connection...\n";
    // Next step: Update the token in the client and connect to Discord
  });
```

#### Server-to-Server Get Token Exchange

If your application uses a backend server and does **not** have `Public Client` enabled, you can manually exchange the authorization code for an access token using the Discord API.

``` python
import requests

API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'

def exchange_code(code, redirect_uri):
    data = {
        'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
        'code': code,
        'redirect_uri': redirect_uri
    }
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}
    r = requests.post(f'{API_ENDPOINT}/oauth2/token', data=data, headers=headers, auth=(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))
    r.raise_for_status()
    return r.json()
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "access_token": "<access token>",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 604800,
  "refresh_token": "<refresh token>",
  "scope": "sdk.social_layer"
}
```

## Working with Tokens

Once you've received your access token, you'll want to set the token in the SDK. You can use [`Client::UpdateToken`] to do that. At this point, you're authorized and ready to go! You'll want to store the player's access token and refresh tokens somewhere.

Please note that the `access_token` values do expire. You'll need to use the `refresh_token` to refresh the player's access token.

```cpp
client->UpdateToken(discordpp::AuthorizationTokenType::Bearer, ACCESS_TOKEN_VALUE, [client](discordpp::ClientResult result) {
  client->Connect();
);
```

---

## Refreshing Access Tokens

Access tokens expire after 7 days, requiring refresh tokens to get a new one.

### Refreshing Access Tokens for Public Clients

<PublicClient />

The easiest way to refresh tokens is using the SDK's [`Client::RefreshToken`] method.

``` cpp
client->RefreshToken(
      YOUR_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID, GetRefreshToken(),
      [client](discordpp::ClientResult result, std::string accessToken,
               std::string refreshToken,
               discordpp::AuthorizationTokenType tokenType, int32_t expiresIn,
               std::string scope) {
        if (!result.Successful()) {
          std::cout << "❌ Error refreshing token: " << result.Error()
                    << std::endl;
          return;
        }

        // Update token and connect
        UpdateToken(client, refreshToken, accessToken);
      });
```

### Server-to-Server Token Refresh

If you're handling authentication on your server, send an API request to refresh the token.

```python
import requests

API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'

def refresh_token(refresh_token):
    data = {
        'grant_type': 'refresh_token',
        'refresh_token': refresh_token
    }
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}
    r = requests.post(f'{API_ENDPOINT}/oauth2/token', data=data, headers=headers, auth=(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))
    r.raise_for_status()
    return r.json()
```

---

## Revoking Access Tokens

If a user wants to disconnect their Discord account or if a token is compromised, you can revoke access and refresh tokens.

### Server-to-Server Token Revocation

```python
import requests

API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'

def revoke_token(access_or_refresh_token):
    data = {'token': access_or_refresh_token}
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}
    r = requests.post(f'{API_ENDPOINT}/oauth2/token', data=data, headers=headers, auth=(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET))
    r.raise_for_status()
```
