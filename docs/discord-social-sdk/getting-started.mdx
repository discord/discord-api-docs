# Getting Started with the Discord Social SDK

The Discord Social SDK allows you to integrate Discord social features into your game. With the Discord Social SDK, you can offer a seamless social experience for your players, allowing them to connect with their friends and communities on Discord without leaving your game.

If this is your first time learning about the Discord Social SDK, check out the Discord Social SDK [Overview](/docs/discord-social-sdk/overview) and [Core Concepts](/docs/discord-social-sdk/core-concepts) for more information on what the SDK can do and how it can benefit your game.

## Let's Get Started

Select a platform to get started.

If you are unsure which platform to choose, we recommend starting with the C++ guide to familiarize yourself with the SDK's core concepts.

## Next Steps
