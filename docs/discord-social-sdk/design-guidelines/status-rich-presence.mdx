# Status & Rich Presence

This guide provides best practices and design guidelines for integrating status and rich presence features within your game. These features are essential for enhancing player engagement and providing real-time information about player activities.

By following this guide, you will learn how to:

- Implement a status matrix to display player statuses in your friends list.
- Apply core style guidelines to ensure consistency and player comprehension.
- Customize the appearance to fit your game while maintaining the essential elements of status indicators.

## Status matrix

## Side-by-side

Any of the **core statuses** (online, idle, DND, offline) will always be the same between the game and the Discord client.

You can customize the status icon, but custom icons will only render within the game.

## Core style guidelines

To ensure player comprehension, keep the **core colors, symbols, and information architecture consistent** across Discord-powered games — with choice of styling of applied. 

In other words, as long as the status colors read as yellow/green/red, and the symbols as moon/circle/minus/offline, **all other styling is the game's choice**. 

Avatars are not required.

## Rich Presence

The game developer should set rich presence — this will show in both the Discord and game client. 

Please refer to [**Setting Rich Presence**](/docs/discord-social-sdk/development-guides/setting-rich-presence) for more information on Rich Presence, such as other types of traits that can be included.
