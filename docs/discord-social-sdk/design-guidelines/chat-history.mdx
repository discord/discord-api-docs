# Chat History


## Style recommendations

Chat history is a highly requested **optional** feature that helps players pick up conversations where they left off—whether they're returning to a lobby or jumping back into a linked channel.

We recommend showing **timestamps** to give players better context about when messages were sent and seen.

## Display logic

If one player is messaging from a game lobby or linked channel, then chat history is preserved, even if the other player is messaging from Discord.

When players return to a lobby or open a linked channel, we recommend surfacing **10 to 15** of the most recent messages to provide meaningful context. This isn't a hard limit—older messages can be revealed through scroll or loading more content, depending on your UI constraints.
