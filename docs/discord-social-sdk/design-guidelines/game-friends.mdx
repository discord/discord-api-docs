## User needs

We've heard from players that they want more of a distinction between connections they make in-game, and friends they spend time with on Discord outside of and across games. Someone I party up with may not necessarily be my "friend". 

Users want more controls over how in-game relationships extend beyond the game client with communication, presence, and identity.

## Game Friends — A new tier

Discord is introducing a new tier of friendship called **Game Friends**.

Game Friends are a way to create an in-game relationship with another player that provides all of the in-game benefits, but limits how the relationship extends outside the game.

## Game vs Discord Friends

### Communication 

A Game Friend **can reach Discord-connected friends outside the game** by DMing those in the game who are offline — these messages will be received on the Discord client. Discord provides players a setting to disable receiving DMs from Game Friends.

### Presence

A Game Friend **cannot see your rich presence** beyond the game your friendship originated in. The exception is if both friends have their Discord accounts connected and are in a shared server.

## Equally-weighted

When adding a new friend, **present two options to players with "Game Friends" listed first**, since it's the more localized/limited friend-tier. Please ensure that neither type of friend is pre-selected in the UI — present them equally to the user (ordering aside for above reasons).

## Adding friends

If the user is not yet a friend, show both options of adding as either a Game or Discord Friend.

If a user is already your Game Friend, show the action to also add them on Discord.

## Removing friends

When removing a Game Friend or Discord Friend, show players the standard "Remove Friend" action. The SDK will remove the friend across whatever friendships are applicable.

## Style guidelines

When removing a Game Friend or Discord Friend, show players the standard "Remove Friend" action. The SDK will remove the friend across whatever friendships are applicable.

## UX, not UI

The visual styling of the "Add Friend" menu-items is not intended to be prescriptive. So long as both options are equally-weighted, please use whichever UI fits your game's needs.
