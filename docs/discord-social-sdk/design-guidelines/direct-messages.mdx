# Direct Messages


## Badge when online elsewhere

The badging logic in direct-messages is consistent with the logic detailed in the [Unified Friends List](/docs/discord-social-sdk/design-guidelines/unified-friends-list) section.

If the user is **online elsewhere** and is not in the game client, their usernames will include a **Discord badge**. Once they're online in the game-client, they will not retain the Discord badge.

## Message styling

Style the Discord logo to match a player's username color. The logo should feel tied to a user's identity, not the message content.

## Unsupported rich media
Regardless of whether a user has signed into Discord, unsupported rich media content should be paired with an **external link icon**.

When content isn't clickable, don't show the icon.
