# Hosting a Reddit API Discord app on Cloudflare Workers

When building Discord apps, your app can receive common events from the client as [webhooks](#DOCS_RESOURCES_WEBHOOK) when users interact with your app through interactions like [application commands](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS) or [message components](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS).

Discord will send these events to a pre-configured HTTPS endpoint (called an Interactions Endpoint URL in an app's configuration) as a JSON payload with details about the event.

This tutorial walks through building a Discord app powered by [`r/aww`](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww) using JavaScript:

All of the code for this app can be found **[on GitHub](https://github.com/discord/cloudflare-sample-app)**.

### Features and technologies used

- [Discord Interactions API](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING) (specifically slash commands)
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) for hosting
- [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) to send messages back to the user

---

## Creating an app on Discord

To start, we'll create the app through the [Discord Developer Dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications):

- Visit https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Click `New Application`, and choose a name
- Copy your **Public Key** and **Application ID**, and put them somewhere locally (we'll need these later)

![IDs found in app settings](cloudflare-general-overview.png)

- Now click on the **Bot** tab on the left sidebar.
- Grab the `token` for your bot, and store it somewhere safe (I like to put these tokens in a password manager like [1password](https://1password.com/) or [lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/)).

> warn
> For security reasons, you can only view your bot token once. If you misplace your token, you'll have to generate a new one.

## Adding bot permissions

Now we'll configure the bot with [permissions](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS) required to create and use slash commands, as well as send messages in  channels.

- Click on the `OAuth2` tab, and choose the `URL Generator`. Click the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes.
- Check the boxes next to `Send Messages` and `Use Slash Commands`, then copy the `Generated URL`.

![Configuring bot permissions in app settings](cloudflare-url-generator.png)

- Paste the URL into the browser and follow the OAuth flow, selecting the server where you'd like to develop and test your bot.

## Creating your Cloudflare Worker

Cloudflare Workers are a convenient way to host Discord apps due to the free tier, simple development model, and automatically managed environment (no VMs!).

> warn
> When using Cloudflare Workers, your app won't be able to access non-ephemeral CDN media. For example, trying to fetch an image like `https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1234/56789/my_image.png` would result in a `403` error. Cloudflare Workers are still able to access ephemeral CDN media.

- Visit the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
- Click on the `Workers` tab, and create a new service using the same name as your Discord bot
- Make sure to [install the Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update/) and set it up.

### Storing secrets

The production service needs access to some of the information we saved earlier. To set those variables, run:

```
$ wrangler secret put DISCORD_TOKEN
$ wrangler secret put DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY
$ wrangler secret put DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID
```

You'll also need the Guild ID for the server where your app is installed. This can be found in the URL when you visit any channel in that server.

> info
> For example, if my URL was `https://discord.com/channels/123456/789101112`, the Guild ID is the first number—in this case **`123456`**.

Once you know your Guild ID, set that variable as well:

```
$ wrangler secret put DISCORD_TEST_GUILD_ID
```

## Running locally

> info
> This depends on the beta version of the `wrangler` package, which better supports ESM on Cloudflare Workers.

Let's start by cloning the repository and installing dependencies. This requires at least v16 of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/):

```
$ npm install
```

### Project structure

A brief look at the cloned app's project structure:

```

│   ├── reddit.js             -> Interactions with the Reddit API

├── .prettierrc.json
└── .gitignore
```

### Registering commands

Before testing our app, we need to register our desired slash commands. For this app, we'll have a `/awwww` command, and a `/invite` command. The name and description for these are kept separate in `commands.js`:

```js
export const AWW_COMMAND = {
  name: 'awwww',
  description: 'Drop some cuteness on this channel.',
};

export const INVITE_COMMAND = {
  name: 'invite',
  description: 'Get an invite link to add the bot to your server',
};
```

The code to register commands lives in `register.js`. Commands can be [registered globally](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/create-global-application-command), making them available for all servers with the app installed, or they can be [registered on a single server](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/create-guild-application-command).

In this example - we'll just focus on global commands:

```js
import { AWW_COMMAND, INVITE_COMMAND } from './commands.js';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

/**
 * This file is meant to be run from the command line, and is not used by the
 * application server.  It's allowed to use node.js primitives, and only needs
 * to be run once.
 */

const token = process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN;
const applicationId = process.env.DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID;

if (!token) {
  throw new Error('The DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable is required.');
}
if (!applicationId) {
  throw new Error(
    'The DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID environment variable is required.'
  );
}

/**
 * Register all commands globally.  This can take o(minutes), so wait until
 * you're sure these are the commands you want.
 */
async function registerGlobalCommands() {
  const url = `https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/${applicationId}/commands`;
  await registerCommands(url);
}

async function registerCommands(url) {
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bot ${token}`,
    },
    method: 'PUT',
    body: JSON.stringify([AWW_COMMAND, INVITE_COMMAND]),
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    console.log('Registered all commands');
  } else {
    console.error('Error registering commands');
    const text = await response.text();
    console.error(text);
  }
  return response;
}

await registerGlobalCommands();
```

### Running the server

This command needs to be run locally, once before getting started:

```
$ DISCORD_TOKEN=**** DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=**** node src/register.js
```

We're finally ready to run this code locally! Let's start by running our local development server:

```
$ npm run dev
```

### Setting up ngrok

When a user types a slash command, Discord will send an HTTP request to a public endpoint. During local development this can be a little challenging, so we're going to use [a tool called `ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) to create an HTTP tunnel.

```
$ npm run ngrok
```

![ngrok forwarding address](cloudflare-ngrok.png)

This is going to bounce requests off of an external endpoint, and forward them to your machine. Copy the HTTPS link provided by the tool. It should look something like `https://8098-24-22-245-250.ngrok.io`.

Now head back to the Discord Developer Dashboard, and update the `Interactions Endpoint URL` for your app:

![Interactions Endpoint URL](cloudflare-interactions-endpoint.png)

This is the process we'll use for local testing and development. When you've published your app to Cloudflare, you will **want to update this field to use your Cloudflare Worker URL.**

## Deployment

This repository is set up to automatically deploy to Cloudflare Workers when new changes land on the `main` branch. To deploy manually, run `npm run publish`, which uses the `wrangler publish` command under the hood.

Publishing via a GitHub Action requires obtaining an [API Token and your Account ID from Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/authentication/). These are stored [as secrets in the GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), making them available to GitHub Actions.

The following configuration in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` demonstrates how to tie it all together:

```yaml
release:
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [test, lint]
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: 16
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm run publish
      env:
        CF_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
        CF_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.CF_ACCOUNT_ID }}
```

## Code deep dive

Most of the interesting code in this app lives in `src/server.js`. Cloudflare Workers require exposing a `fetch` function, which is called as the entry point for each request. This code will largely do two things for us: validate the request is valid and actually came from Discord, and hand the request over to a router to help give us a little more control over execution.

```js
export default {
  /**
   * Every request to a worker will start in the `fetch` method.
   * Verify the signature with the request, and dispatch to the router.
   * @param {*} request A Fetch Request object
   * @param {*} env A map of key/value pairs with env vars and secrets from the cloudflare env.
   * @returns
   */
  async fetch(request, env) {
    if (request.method === 'POST') {
      // Using the incoming headers, verify this request actually came from discord.
      const signature = request.headers.get('x-signature-ed25519');
      const timestamp = request.headers.get('x-signature-timestamp');
      const body = await request.clone().arrayBuffer();
      const isValidRequest = verifyKey(
        body,
        signature,
        timestamp,
        env.DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY
      );
      if (!isValidRequest) {
        console.error('Invalid Request');
        return new Response('Bad request signature.', { status: 401 });
      }
    }

    // Dispatch the request to the appropriate route
    return router.handle(request, env);
  },
};
```

All of the API calls from Discord in this example will be POSTed to `/`. From here, we will use the [`discord-interactions`](https://github.com/discord/discord-interactions-js) npm module to help us interpret the event, and to send results.

```js
/**
 * Main route for all requests sent from Discord.  All incoming messages will
 * include a JSON payload described here:
 * https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object
 */
router.post('/', async (request, env) => {
  const message = await request.json();
  console.log(message);
  if (message.type === InteractionType.PING) {
    // The `PING` message is used during the initial webhook handshake, and is
    // required to configure the webhook in the developer portal.
    console.log('Handling Ping request');
    return new JsonResponse({
      type: InteractionResponseType.PONG,
    });
  }

  if (message.type === InteractionType.APPLICATION_COMMAND) {
    // Most user commands will come as `APPLICATION_COMMAND`.
    switch (message.data.name.toLowerCase()) {
      case AWW_COMMAND.name.toLowerCase(): {
        console.log('handling cute request');
        const cuteUrl = await getCuteUrl();
        return new JsonResponse({
          type: InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
          data: {
            content: cuteUrl,
          },
        });
      }
      case INVITE_COMMAND.name.toLowerCase(): {
        const applicationId = env.DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID;
        const INVITE_URL = `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=${applicationId}&scope=applications.commands`;
        return new JsonResponse({
          type: InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
          data: {
            content: INVITE_URL,
            flags: InteractionResponseFlags.EPHEMERAL,
          },
        });
      }
      default:
        console.error('Unknown Command');
        return new JsonResponse({ error: 'Unknown Type' }, { status: 400 });
    }
  }

  console.error('Unknown Type');
  return new JsonResponse({ error: 'Unknown Type' }, { status: 400 });
});
```

## Next steps

> info
> In case you need to reference any of the code, you can find the repo [on GitHub](https://github.com/discord/cloudflare-sample-app)

With your app built and deployed, you can start customizing it to be your own:

- Use **[message components](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_MESSAGE_COMPONENTS)** in your app to add more interactivity (like buttons and select menus).
- Take a look at different **[public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)** on GitHub.
- Join the **[Discord Developers server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers)** to ask questions about the API, attend events hosted by the Discord API team, and interact with other developers.
