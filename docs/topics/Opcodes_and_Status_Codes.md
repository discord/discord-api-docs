# Opcodes and Status Codes

## Gateway

All gateway events in Discord are tagged with an opcode that denotes the payload type. Your connection to our gateway may also sometimes close. When it does, you will receive a close code that tells you what happened.

###### Gateway Opcodes

| Code | Name                      | Client Action | Description                                                                             |

| 1    | Heartbeat                 | Send/Receive  | Fired periodically by the client to keep the connection alive.                          |

| 4    | Voice State Update        | Send          | Used to join/leave or move between voice channels.                                      |
| 6    | Resume                    | Send          | Resume a previous session that was disconnected.                                        |
| 7    | Reconnect                 | Receive       | You should attempt to reconnect and resume immediately.                                 |
| 8    | Request Guild Members     | Send          | Request information about offline guild members in a large guild.                       |
| 9    | Invalid Session           | Receive       | The session has been invalidated. You should reconnect and identify/resume accordingly. |
| 10   | Hello                     | Receive       | Sent immediately after connecting, contains the `heartbeat_interval` to use.            |
| 11   | Heartbeat ACK             | Receive       | Sent in response to receiving a heartbeat to acknowledge that it has been received.     |
| 31   | Request Soundboard Sounds | Send          | Request information about soundboard sounds in a set of guilds.                         |

###### Gateway Close Event Codes

In order to prevent broken reconnect loops, you should consider some close codes as a signal to stop reconnecting. This can be because your token expired, or your identification is invalid. This table explains what the application defined close codes for the gateway are, and which close codes you should not attempt to reconnect.

## HTTP

Our API will return semantically valid HTTP response codes based on the success of your request. The following table can be used as a reference for response codes it will return.

###### HTTP Response Codes

| Code                      | Meaning                                                                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200 (OK)                  | The request completed successfully.                                              |
| 201 (CREATED)             | The entity was created successfully.                                             |
| 204 (NO CONTENT)          | The request completed successfully but returned no content.                      |
| 304 (NOT MODIFIED)        | The entity was not modified (no action was taken).                               |
| 400 (BAD REQUEST)         | The request was improperly formatted, or the server couldn't understand it.      |
| 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)        | The `Authorization` header was missing or invalid.                               |
| 403 (FORBIDDEN)           | The `Authorization` token you passed did not have permission to the resource.    |
| 404 (NOT FOUND)           | The resource at the location specified doesn't exist.                            |
| 405 (METHOD NOT ALLOWED)  | The HTTP method used is not valid for the location specified.                    |
| 429 (TOO MANY REQUESTS)   | You are being rate limited, see [Rate Limits](#DOCS_TOPICS_RATE_LIMITS).         |
| 502 (GATEWAY UNAVAILABLE) | There was not a gateway available to process your request. Wait a bit and retry. |
| 5xx (SERVER ERROR)        | The server had an error processing your request (these are rare).                |

## JSON

Along with the HTTP error code, our API can also return more detailed error codes through a `code` key in the JSON error response. The response will also contain a `message` key containing a more friendly error string. Some of these errors may include additional details in the form of [Error Messages](#DOCS_REFERENCE/error-messages) provided by an `errors` object.

###### JSON Error Codes
