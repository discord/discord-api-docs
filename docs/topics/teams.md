# Teams

Teams are groups of developers (or other Discord users) who want to collaborate and share access to an app's configuration, management, and payout settings. Go team(s)!

## Creating a Team

To create or be a member on a team, you must [enable 2FA for your Discord account](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication). After you have 2FA enabled, create a team by navigating to the [Teams page](https://discord.com/developers/teams) then clicking the "New Team" button.

Once you create a team, you'll land on the **Team Information** page where you can fill out details and start inviting other Discord users to join your team. Since users added to a team have access to any apps that team owns, use caution when adding new team members.

> info
> Only the team Owner and team Admins can invite or remove additional users.

## Adding Apps to a Team

Once your team is set up, you can create or transfer apps that will be owned by the team. Teams can have a maximum of 25 apps.

### Creating an App

To create a new app that belongs to a team, select the team from the **Team** dropdown in the app creation modal. If you want to keep the app under your own account's ownership, choose `Personal`:

### Transferring an App

To transfer an existing app to a team, navigate to the [Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications) that you want to transfer. At the bottom of the app's **General Information** page, click "Transfer App to Team".

## Team Member Roles

Team members can be one of four roles (owner, admin, developer, and read-only), and each role inherits the access of those below it. Roles for team members can be configured under **Team Members** in a team's settings.

###### Team Member Role Types

| Role Name | Value     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Owner\*   |           | Owners are the most permissible role, and can take destructive, irreversible actions like deleting team-owned apps or the team itself. Teams are limited to 1 owner.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Admin     | admin     | Admins have similar access as owners, except they cannot take destructive actions on the team or team-owned apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Developer | developer | Developers can access information about team-owned apps, like the client secret or public key. They can also take limited actions on team-owned apps, like configuring interaction endpoints or resetting the bot token. Members with the Developer role *cannot* manage the team or its members, or take destructive actions on team-owned apps. |
| Read-only | read_only | Read-only members can access information about a team and any team-owned apps. Some examples include getting the IDs of applications and exporting payout records. Members can also invite bots associated with team-owned apps that are marked private.                                                                                          |

\* The owner role is not represented in the `role` field on the [team member object](#DOCS_TOPICS_TEAMS/data-models-team-member-object). Instead, the `owner_user_id` field  on the [team object](#DOCS_TOPICS_TEAMS/data-models-team-object) should be used to identify which user has the owner role for the team.
