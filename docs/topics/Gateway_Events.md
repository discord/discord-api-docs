# Gateway Events

Gateway connections are WebSockets, meaning they're bidirectional and either side of the WebSocket can send events to the other. The following events are split up into two types:

- **Send events** are Gateway events sent by an app to Discord (like when identifying with the Gateway)
- **Receive events** are Gateway events that are sent by Discord to an app. These events typically represent something happening inside of a server where an app is installed, like a channel being updated.

All Gateway events are encapsulated in a [Gateway event payload](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/payload-structure).

For more information about interacting with the Gateway, you can reference the [Gateway documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY).

> warn
> Not all Gateway event fields are documented. You should assume that undocumented fields are not supported for apps, and their format and data may change at any time.

### Event Names

In practice, event names are UPPER-CASED with under_scores joining each word in the name. For instance, [Channel Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/channel-create) would be `CHANNEL_CREATE` and [Voice State Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/voice-state-update) would be `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE`.

For readability, event names in the following documentation are typically left in Title Case.

### Payload Structure

Gateway event payloads have a common structure, but the contents of the associated data (`d`) varies between the different events.

| Field | Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                      |
|-------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| op    | integer                 | [Gateway opcode](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-gateway-opcodes), which indicates the payload type                                |
| d     | ?mixed (any JSON value) | Event data                                                                                                                                       |
| s     | ?integer \*             | Sequence number of event used for [resuming sessions](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resuming) and [heartbeating](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sending-heartbeats) |
| t     | ?string \*              | Event name                                                                                                                                       |

\* `s` and `t` are `null` when `op` is not `0` ([Gateway Dispatch opcode](#DOCS_TOPICS_OPCODES_AND_STATUS_CODES/gateway-gateway-opcodes)).

    // This connection will only receive the events defined in those three intents
    "intents": 7
  }
}
```

#### Resume

Used to replay missed events when a disconnected client resumes.

Details about resuming are in the [Gateway documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resuming).

###### Resume Structure

| Field      | Type    | Description                   |
|------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| token      | string  | Session token                 |
| session_id | string  | Session ID                    |
| seq        | integer | Last sequence number received |

###### Example Resume

```json
{
  "op": 6,
  "d": {
    "token": "randomstring",
    "session_id": "evenmorerandomstring",
    "seq": 1337
  }
}
```

#### Heartbeat

Used to maintain an active gateway connection. Must be sent every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds after the [Opcode 10 Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/hello) payload is received. The inner `d` key is the last sequence number—`s`—received by the client. If you have not yet received one, send `null`.

Details about heartbeats are in the [Gateway documentation](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/sending-heartbeats).

###### Example Heartbeat

```json
{
  "op": 1,
  "d": 251
}
```

#### Request Guild Members

Used to request all members for a guild or a list of guilds. When initially connecting, if you don't have the `GUILD_PRESENCES` [Gateway Intent](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents), or if the guild is over 75k members, it will only send members who are in voice, plus the member for you (the connecting user). Otherwise, if a guild has over `large_threshold` members (value in the [Gateway Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/identify)), it will only send members who are online, have a role, have a nickname, or are in a voice channel, and if it has under `large_threshold` members, it will send all members. If a client wishes to receive additional members, they need to explicitly request them via this operation. The server will send [Guild Members Chunk](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-members-chunk) events in response with up to 1000 members per chunk until all members that match the request have been sent.

Due to our privacy and infrastructural concerns with this feature, there are some limitations that apply:

- `GUILD_PRESENCES` intent is required to set `presences = true`. Otherwise, it will always be false
- `GUILD_MEMBERS` intent is required to request the entire member list—`(query=‘’, limit=0<=n)`
- You will be limited to requesting 1 `guild_id` per request
- Requesting a prefix (`query` parameter) will return a maximum of 100 members
- Requesting `user_ids` will continue to be limited to returning 100 members

| limit      | integer                          | maximum number of members to send matching the `query`; a limit of `0` can be used with an empty string `query` to return all members | true when specifying query |
| presences? | boolean                          | used to specify if we want the presences of the matched members                                                                       | false                      |
| user_ids?  | snowflake or array of snowflakes | used to specify which users you wish to fetch                                                                                         | one of query or user_ids   |
| nonce?     | string                           | nonce to identify the [Guild Members Chunk](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-members-chunk) response                                 | false                      |

> info
> Nonce can only be up to 32 bytes. If you send an invalid nonce it will be ignored and the reply member_chunk(s) will not have a nonce set.

## Receive Events

Receive events are Gateway events encapsulated in an [event payload](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/payload-structure), and are sent by Discord to an app through a Gateway connection. Receive events correspond to events that happen in a Discord server where the app is installed.

#### Hello

Sent on connection to the websocket. Defines the heartbeat interval that an app should heartbeat to.

###### Hello Structure

| Field              | Type    | Description                                             |
|--------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| heartbeat_interval | integer | Interval (in milliseconds) an app should heartbeat with |

###### Example Hello

```json
{
  "op": 10,
  "d": {
    "heartbeat_interval": 45000
  }
}
```

#### Ready

The ready event is dispatched when a client has completed the initial handshake with the gateway (for new sessions). The ready event can be the largest and most complex event the gateway will send, as it contains all the state required for a client to begin interacting with the rest of the platform.

`guilds` are the guilds of which your bot is a member. They start out as unavailable when you connect to the gateway. As they become available, your bot will be notified via [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-create) events.

#### Resumed

The resumed event is dispatched when a client has sent a [resume payload](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/resume) to the gateway (for resuming existing sessions).

#### Reconnect

The reconnect event is dispatched when a client should reconnect to the gateway (and resume their existing session, if they have one). This can occur at any point in the gateway connection lifecycle, even before/in place of receiving a [Hello](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/hello) event. A few seconds after the reconnect event is dispatched, the connection may be closed by the server.

###### Example Gateway Reconnect

```json
{
  "op": 7,
  "d": null
}
```

#### Invalid Session

Sent to indicate one of at least three different situations:

- the gateway could not initialize a session after receiving an [Opcode 2 Identify](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/identify)
- the gateway could not resume a previous session after receiving an [Opcode 6 Resume](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/resume)
- the gateway has invalidated an active session and is requesting client action

The inner `d` key is a boolean that indicates whether the session may be resumable. See [Connecting](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/connecting) and [Resuming](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/resuming) for more information.

###### Example Gateway Invalid Session

```json
{
  "op": 9,
  "d": false
}
```

### Application Commands

#### Application Command Permissions Update

`APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS_UPDATE` event, sent when an application command's permissions are updated. The inner payload is an [application command permissions](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/application-command-permissions-object-guild-application-command-permissions-structure) object.

### Auto Moderation

All [Auto Moderation](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUTO_MODERATION) related events are only sent to bot users which have the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission.

#### Auto Moderation Rule Create

Sent when a rule is created. The inner payload is an [auto moderation rule](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUTO_MODERATION/auto-moderation-rule-object) object.

#### Auto Moderation Rule Update

Sent when a rule is updated. The inner payload is an [auto moderation rule](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUTO_MODERATION/auto-moderation-rule-object) object.

#### Auto Moderation Rule Delete

Sent when a rule is deleted. The inner payload is an [auto moderation rule](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUTO_MODERATION/auto-moderation-rule-object) object.

#### Auto Moderation Action Execution

Sent when a rule is triggered and an action is executed (e.g. when a message is blocked).

###### Auto Moderation Action Execution Event Fields

### Entitlements

#### Entitlement Create

> danger
> Starting on October 1st, 2024, the `ENTITLEMENT_CREATE` event will have an `ends_at` value of null. Please see the [Change Log and Entitlement Migration Guide](#DOCS_CHANGE_LOG/subscription-api-and-entitlement-migration) for more information.

Sent when an entitlement is created. The inner payload is an [entitlement](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/entitlement-object) object.

#### Entitlement Update

> danger
> Starting on October 1, 2024, the `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event behavior will be changing. You will no longer receive an `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event on successful renewal When a user cancels, you will receive an `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` events with an `ends_at` value when the subscription ends. See the [Change Log and Entitlement Migration Guide](#DOCS_CHANGE_LOG/subscription-api-and-entitlement-migration) for more information.

Sent when an entitlement is updated. The inner payload is an [entitlement](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/entitlement-object) object. 

For subscription entitlements, when a user's subscription is renewed you will receive an `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` event with a new `ends_at` date that reflects the end of the new billing period.

If a user cancels their subscription, you will stop receiving `ENTITLEMENT_UPDATE` events that update the `ends_at` value.

#### Entitlement Delete

Sent when an entitlement is deleted. The inner payload is an [entitlement](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/entitlement-object) object. 

Entitlement deletions are infrequent, and occur when:

- Discord issues a refund for a subscription
- Discord removes an entitlement from a user via internal tooling
- Discord deletes an app-managed entitlement they created via the API

Entitlements are _not_ deleted when they expire.

### Guilds

#### Guild Create

This event can be sent in three different scenarios:

1. When a user is initially connecting, to lazily load and backfill information for all unavailable guilds sent in the [Ready](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/ready) event. Guilds that are unavailable due to an outage will send a [Guild Delete](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-delete) event.
2. When a Guild becomes available again to the client.
3. When the current user joins a new Guild.

> note
> During an outage, the guild object in scenarios 1 and 3 may be marked as unavailable.

The inner payload can be:

- An available Guild: a [guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object) object with extra fields, as noted below.
- An unavailable Guild: an [unavailable guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/unavailable-guild-object) object.

### Messages

> warn
> Unlike persistent messages, ephemeral messages are sent directly to the user and the bot who sent the message rather than through the guild channel. Because of this, ephemeral messages are tied to the [`DIRECT_MESSAGES` intent](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/list-of-intents), and the message object won't include `guild_id` or `member`.

#### Message Create

Sent when a message is created. The inner payload is a [message](#DOCS_RESOURCES_MESSAGE/message-object) object with the following extra fields:

### Presence

#### Presence Update

> warn
> If you are using [Gateway Intents](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents), you _must_ specify the `GUILD_PRESENCES` intent in order to receive Presence Update events

A user's presence is their current state on a guild. This event is sent when a user's presence or info, such as name or avatar, is updated.

> warn
> The user object within this event can be partial, the only field which must be sent is the `id` field, everything else is optional. Along with this limitation, no fields are required, and the types of the fields are **not** validated. Your client should expect any combination of fields and types within this event.

> info
> Subscription status should not be used to grant perks. Use [entitlements](#DOCS_RESOURCES_ENTITLEMENT/entitlement-object) as an indication of whether a user should have access to a specific SKU.
