## August 3, 2017 - Breaking Change

After today, we are changing how default channels function. The "default" channel for a given user is now the channel with the highest position that their permissions allow them to see. New guilds will no longer have a default channel with the same id as the guild. Existing guilds will not have their #general channel id changed. It is possible, if permissions are set in such a way, that a user will not have a default channel in a guild.

We saw a use case in many servers where the previously-default #general channel was being repurposed as an announcement-only, non-writable channel for new members by using bots to clear the entire message history. Now, that channel can simply be deleted and re-created with the desired permissions. This change also allows dynamic default channels for users based on permissions.

Audit logs are here! Well, they've been here all along, but now we've got [documentation](#DOCS_AUDIT_LOG/audit-logs) about them. Check it out, but remember: with great power comes great responsibility.
