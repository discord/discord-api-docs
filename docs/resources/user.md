# Users Resource

Users in Discord are generally considered the base entity. Users can spawn across the entire platform, be members of
guilds, participate in text and voice chat, and much more. Users are separated by a distinction of "bot" vs "normal." Although they are similar, bot users are automated users that are "owned" by another user. Unlike normal users, bot users do
_not_ have a limitation on the number of Guilds they can be a part of.

## Usernames and Nicknames

Discord enforces the following restrictions for usernames and nicknames:

1. Names can contain most valid unicode characters. We limit some zero-width and non-rendering characters.
2. Usernames must be between 2 and 32 characters long.
3. Nicknames must be between 1 and 32 characters long.
4. Names are sanitized and trimmed of leading, trailing, and excessive internal whitespace.

The following restrictions are additionally enforced for usernames:

1. Usernames cannot contain the following substrings: `@`, `#`, `:`, ` ``` `, `discord`
2. Usernames cannot be: `everyone`, `here`

There are other rules and restrictions not shared here for the sake of spam and abuse mitigation, but the majority of users won't encounter them. It's important to properly handle all error messages returned by Discord when editing or updating names.
