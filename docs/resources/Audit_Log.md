# Audit Logs Resource

## Audit Logs

When an administrative action is performed in a guild, an entry is added to its audit log. Viewing audit logs requires the `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG` permission and can be fetched by apps using the [`GET /guilds/{guild.id}/audit-logs` endpoint](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/get-guild-audit-log), or seen by users in the guild's **Server Settings**. All audit log entries are stored for 45 days.

When an app is performing an eligible action using the APIs, it can pass an `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header to indicate why the action was taken. More information is in the [audit log entry](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-entry-object) section.

\* Threads referenced in `THREAD_CREATE` and `THREAD_UPDATE` events are included in the threads map since archived threads might not be kept in memory by clients.

}
```

### Audit Log Entry Object

Each audit log entry represents a single administrative action (or [event](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-entry-object-audit-log-events)), indicated by `action_type`. Most entries contain one to many changes in the `changes` array that affected an entity in Discordâ€”whether that's a user, channel, guild, emoji, or something else.

The information (and structure) of an entry's changes will be different depending on its type. For example, in `MEMBER_ROLE_UPDATE` events there is only one change: a member is either added or removed from a specific role. However, in `CHANNEL_CREATE` events there are many changes, including (but not limited to) the channel's name, type, and permission overwrites added. More details are in the [change object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-change-object) section.

Apps can specify why an administrative action is being taken by passing an `X-Audit-Log-Reason` request header, which will be stored as the audit log entry's `reason` field. The `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header supports 1-512 URL-encoded UTF-8 characters. Reasons are visible to users in the client and to apps when fetching audit log entries with the API.

| action_type | [audit log event](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-entry-object-audit-log-events)                    | Type of action that occurred                          |

> warn
> For `APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSION_UPDATE` events, the `target_id` is the command ID or the app ID since the `changes` array represents the entire `permissions` property on the [guild permissions](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/application-command-permissions-object-guild-application-command-permissions-structure) object.

###### Audit Log Events

The table below lists audit log events and values (the `action_type` field) that your app may receive.

The **Object Changed** column notes which object's values may be included in the entry. Though there are exceptions, possible keys in the `changes` array typically correspond to the object's fields. The descriptions and types for those fields can be found in the linked documentation for the object.

If no object is noted, there won't be a `changes` array in the entry, though other fields like the `target_id` still exist and many have fields in the [`options` array](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-entry-object-optional-audit-entry-info).

> info
> You should assume that your app may run into any field for the changed object, though none are guaranteed to be present. In most cases only a subset of the object's fields will be in the `changes` array.

### Audit Log Change Object

Many audit log events include a `changes` array in their [entry object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-entry-object-audit-log-entry-structure). The [structure for the individual changes](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-change-object-audit-log-change-structure) varies based on the event type and its changed objects, so apps shouldn't depend on a single pattern of handling audit log events.

###### Audit Log Change Structure

Some events don't follow the same pattern as other audit log events. Details about these exceptions are explained in [the next section](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-change-object-audit-log-change-exceptions).

> info
> If `new_value` is not present in the change object while `old_value` is, it indicates that the property has been reset or set to `null`. If `old_value` isn't included, it indicated that the property was previously `null`.

## Get Guild Audit Log % GET /guilds/{guild.id#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object}/audit-logs

Returns an [audit log](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-object) object for the guild. Requires the [`VIEW_AUDIT_LOG`](#DOCS_TOPICS_PERMISSIONS/permissions-bitwise-permission-flags) permission.

The returned list of audit log entries is ordered based on whether you use `before` or `after`. When using `before`, the list is ordered by the audit log entry ID **descending** (newer entries first). If `after` is used, the list is reversed and appears in **ascending** order (older entries first). Omitting both `before` and `after` defaults to `before` the current timestamp and will show the most recent entries in descending order by ID, the opposite can be achieved using `after=0` (showing oldest entries).

###### Query String Params

The following parameters can be used to filter which and how many audit log entries are returned.

| Field        | Type      | Description                                                                                                 |

| action_type? | integer   | Entries for a specific [audit log event](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/audit-log-entry-object-audit-log-events) |

| after?       | snowflake | Entries with ID greater than a specific audit log entry ID                                                  |
| limit?       | integer   | Maximum number of entries (between 1-100) to return, defaults to 50                                         |
