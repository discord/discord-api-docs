# Audit Logs Resource

## Audit Logs

Whenever an administrative action is performed in a guild, an entry is added to its audit log. Viewing audit logs requires the `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG` permission and can be accessed by apps using the [`GET /guilds/{guild.id}/audit-logs` endpoint](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG/get-guild-audit-log), or by users in the guild's Server Settings. Audit log entries are stored for 45 days.

When an app is performing an administrative action using the APIs, it can specify a reason for the action by including the `X-Audit-Log-Reason` request header. This header supports URL-encoded UTF-8 characters.
