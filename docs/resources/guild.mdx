### Membership Screening Object

In guilds with [Membership Screening](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882) enabled, when a member joins, [Guild Member Add](/docs/events/gateway-events#guild-member-add) will be emitted but they will initially be restricted from doing any actions in the guild, and `pending` will be true in the [member object](/docs/resources/guild#guild-member-object). When the member completes the screening, [Guild Member Update](/docs/events/gateway-events#guild-member-update) will be emitted and `pending` will be false.

:::warn
We are making significant changes to the Membership Screening API specifically related to getting and editing the Membership Screening object. Long story short is that it can be improved. As such, we have removed those documentation. There will **not be** any changes to how pending members work, as outlined above. That behavior will stay the same.

:::warn
When using the `roles` parameter, the first member of the array is used to change properties of the guild's `@everyone` role. If you are trying to bootstrap a guild with additional roles, keep this in mind.
:::

:::info
When using the `roles` parameter, the required `id` field within each role object is an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to [overwrite](/docs/resources/channel#overwrite-object) a role's permissions in a channel when also passing in channels with the channels array.
:::

:::warn
When using the `channels` parameter, the `position` field is ignored, and none of the default channels are created.
:::

:::info
When using the `channels` parameter, the `id` field within each channel object may be set to an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to create `GUILD_CATEGORY` channels by setting the `parent_id` field on any children to the category's `id` field. Category channels must be listed before any children.
:::

:::warn
The `region` field is deprecated and is replaced by [channel.rtc_region](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object-channel-structure).

## Delete Guild
<Route method="DELETE">/guilds/[\{guild.id\}](/docs/resources/guild#guild-object)</Route>

Delete a guild permanently. User must be owner. Returns `204 No Content` on success. Fires a [Guild Delete](/docs/events/gateway-events#guild-delete) Gateway event.

## Get Guild Channels
<Route method="GET">/guilds/[\{guild.id\}](/docs/resources/guild#guild-object)/channels</Route>

Returns a list of guild [channel](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object) objects. Does not include threads.

## Create Guild Channel
<Route method="POST">/guilds/[\{guild.id\}](/docs/resources/guild#guild-object)/channels</Route>

Create a new [channel](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object) object for the guild. Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission. If setting permission overwrites, only permissions your bot has in the guild can be allowed/denied. Setting `MANAGE_ROLES` permission in channels is only possible for guild administrators. Returns the new [channel](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object) object on success. Fires a [Channel Create](/docs/events/gateway-events#channel-create) Gateway event.
