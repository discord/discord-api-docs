###### Message Structure

:::info
Fields specific to the `MESSAGE_CREATE` and `MESSAGE_UPDATE` events are listed in the [Gateway documentation](/docs/events/gateway-events#message-create).
:::

:::warn
An app will receive empty values in the `content`, `embeds`, `attachments`, and `components` fields while `poll` will be omitted if they have not configured (or been approved for) the [`MESSAGE_CONTENT` privileged intent (`1 << 15`)](/docs/events/gateway#message-content-intent).

\[1\] The author object follows the structure of the user object, but is only a valid user in the case where the message is generated by a user or bot user. If the message is generated by a webhook, the author object corresponds to the webhook's id, username, and avatar. You can tell if a message is generated by a webhook by checking for the `webhook_id` on the message object.

\[2\] An app will receive empty values in the `content`, `embeds`, `attachments`, and `components` fields while `poll` will be omitted if they have not configured (or been approved for) the [`MESSAGE_CONTENT` privileged intent (`1 << 15`)](/docs/events/gateway#message-content-intent).

\[3\] Not all channel mentions in a message will appear in `mention_channels`. Only textual channels that are visible to everyone in a public guild will ever be included. Only crossposted messages (via Channel Following) currently include `mention_channels` at all. If no mentions in the message meet these requirements, this field will not be sent.

\[4\] This field is only returned for messages with a `type` of `19` (REPLY), `21` (THREAD_STARTER_MESSAGE), or `23` (CONTEXT_MENU_COMMAND). If the message is one of these but the `referenced_message` field is not present, the backend did not attempt to fetch the message that was being replied to, so its state is unknown. If the field exists but is null, the referenced message was deleted.

\[5\] See [message reference types](/docs/resources/message#message-reference-types)

###### Message Types

### Message Call Object

Information about the call in a private channel.

###### Message Call Object Structure

| Field            | Type                | Description                                                                                |

### Message Reference Object

#### Message Reference Structure

| Field               | Type      | Description                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type? \*            | integer   | [type of reference](/docs/resources/message#message-reference-types).                                                                   |
| message_id?         | snowflake | id of the originating message                                                                                                           |
| channel_id? \*\*    | snowflake | id of the originating message's channel                                                                                                 |
| guild_id?           | snowflake | id of the originating message's guild                                                                                                   |
| fail_if_not_exists? | boolean   | when sending, whether to error if the referenced message doesn't exist instead of sending as a normal (non-reply) message, default true |

\* If `type` is unset, `DEFAULT` can be assumed in order to match the behavior before message reference had types.
In future API versions this will become a required field.

\*\* `channel_id` is optional when creating a reply, but will always be present when receiving an event/response that includes this data model. **Required for forwards.**

#### Message Reference Types

Determines how associated data is populated.

| Type    | Value | Coupled Message Field | Description                                              |
|---------|-------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| DEFAULT | 0     | `referenced_message`  | A standard reference used by replies.                    |
| FORWARD | 1     | `message_snapshot`    | Reference used to point to a message at a point in time. |

`FORWARD` can only be used for basic messages; i.e. messages which do not have strong bindings to a non global entity.
Thus we support only messages with type `DEFAULT`, `REPLY`, `CHAT_INPUT_COMMAND`, or `CONTEXT_MENU_COMMAND`, and don't support messages with a poll, call, or activity.
This is subject to change in the future.

#### Message Reference Content Attribution

Message references are generic attribution on a message.
There are multiple message types that have a `message_reference` object.

###### Crosspost messages

- These are messages that originated from another channel (IS_CROSSPOST flag).
- These messages have all three fields, which point to the original message that was crossposted.

###### Channel Follow Add messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a channel is followed into the current channel (type 12).
- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, which point to the followed announcement channel.

###### Pin messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a message is pinned (type 6).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, which point to the message that was pinned.

###### Forwards

- These are messages which capture a snapshot of a message.
- These messages have an array of [`message_snapshot`](/docs/resources/message#message-snapshot-object) objects containing a copy of the original message. This copy follows the same structure as a message, but has only the minimal set of fields returned required for context/rendering.
  - of note: `author` will be excluded
- A forwarded message can be identified by looking at its `message_reference.type` field
  - `message_snapshots` will be the message data associated with the forward. Currently we support only 1 snapshot.
  - prevents spoofing forwarded data
  - `message_snapshots` are taken the moment a forward message is created, and are **immutable**; any mutations to the original message will not be propagated.
- Forwards are created by including a message_reference with `FORWARD` type when sending a message.
  - Required fields: `type`, `message_id`, `channel_id`
  - the requestor must have `VIEW_CHANNEL` permissions

###### Replies

- These are messages replying to a previous message (type 19).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, which point to the message that was replied to. The channel_id and guild_id will be the same as the reply.
- Replies are created by including a message_reference when sending a message. When sending, only `message_id` is required.
- These messages can have the referenced message resolved in the `referenced_message` field.

###### Thread Created messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a public thread is created from an old message or without a message (type 18).
- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, which point to the created thread channel.

###### Thread starter messages

- These are the first message in public threads created from messages. They point back to the message in the parent channel from which the thread was started. (type 21)
- These messages have `message_id`, `channel_id`, and `guild_id`.
- These messages can have the referenced message resolved in the `referenced_message` field.
- These messages will never have content, embeds, or attachments, mainly just the `message_reference` and `referenced_message` fields.

###### Poll result messages

- These are automatic messages sent after a poll has ended and the results have been finalized. (type 46)
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, which point to the original poll message. The `channel_id` will be the same as that of the poll.
- The author will be the same as the author of the poll and will be mentioned.
- These messages contain a [`poll_result` embed](/docs/resources/message#embed-fields-by-embed-type-poll-result-embed-fields)

###### Context Menu Command messages

- These are messages sent when a user uses a context menu Application Command. (type 23)
- If the command was a [message command](/docs/interactions/application-commands#message-commands), the message will have have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, which point to the message that the command was used on. The channel_id and guild_id will be the same as the new message.
- These messages can have the referenced message resolved in the `referenced_message` field.

#### Voice Messages

Voice messages are messages with the `IS_VOICE_MESSAGE` flag. They have the following properties.

- They cannot be edited.
- Only a single audio attachment is allowed. No content, stickers, etc...
- The [attachment](/docs/resources/message#attachment-object) has additional fields: `duration_secs` and `waveform`. The `Content-Type` of the attachment must begin with `audio/` to respect these fields.

The `waveform` is intended to be a preview of the entire voice message, with 1 byte per datapoint encoded in base64. Clients sample the recording at most
once per 100 milliseconds, but will downsample so that no more than 256 datapoints are in the waveform.

As of 2023-04-14, clients upload a 1 channel, 48000 Hz, 32kbps Opus stream in an OGG container.
The encoding, and the waveform details, are an implementation detail and may change without warning or documentation.


### Message Snapshot Object

| Field     | Type                                                             | Description                                       |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| message\* | partial [message](/docs/resources/message#message-object) object | minimal subset of fields in the forwarded message |

\* The current subset of message fields consists of:
`type`, `content`, `embeds`, `attachments`, `timestamp`, `edited_timestamp`, `flags`, `mentions`, `mention_roles`, `stickers`, `sticker_items`, and `components`.

:::info
While message snapshots are able to support nested snapshots, we currently limit the depth of nesting to 1.

###### Embed Limits

To facilitate showing rich content, rich embeds do not follow the traditional limits of message content. However, some limits are still in place to prevent excessively large embeds. The following table describes the limits:

All of the following limits are measured inclusively. Leading and trailing whitespace characters are not included (they are trimmed automatically).

| Field                                                                      | Limit                                                                                |

| [field.name](/docs/resources/message#embed-object-embed-field-structure)   | 256 characters                                                                       |
| [field.value](/docs/resources/message#embed-object-embed-field-structure)  | 1024 characters                                                                      |
| [footer.text](/docs/resources/message#embed-object-embed-footer-structure) | 2048 characters                                                                      |
| [author.name](/docs/resources/message#embed-object-embed-author-structure) | 256 characters                                                                       |

Additionally, the combined sum of characters in all `title`, `description`, `field.name`, `field.value`, `footer.text`, and `author.name` fields across all embeds attached to a message must not exceed 6000 characters. Violating any of these constraints will result in a `Bad Request` response.

Embeds are deduplicated by URL.  If a message contains multiple embeds with the same URL, only the first is shown.

#### Embed Fields by Embed Type

Certain embed types are used to power special UIs. These embeds use [fields](/docs/resources/message#embed-object-embed-field-structure) to include additional data in key-value pairs. Below is a reference of possible embed fields for each of the following embed types.

### Allowed Mentions Object

Setting the `allowed_mentions` field lets you determine whether users will receive notifications when you include mentions in the message content, or the content of components attached to that message. This field is always validated against your permissions and the presence of said mentions in the message, to avoid "phantom" pings where users receive a notification without a visible mention in the message. For example, if you want to ping everyone, including it in the `allowed_mentions` field is not enough, the mention format (`@everyone`) must also be present in the content of the message or its components. It is important to note that setting this field **does not** guarantee a push notification will be sent, as additional factors can influence this:

- To mention roles and notify their members, the role's `mentionable` field must be set to `true`, or the bot must have the `MENTION_EVERYONE` permission
- To mention `@everyone` and `@here`, the bot must have the `MENTION_EVERYONE` permission
- Setting the `SUPPRESS_NOTIFICATIONS` flag when sending a message will disable push notifications and only cause a notification badge
- Users can customize their notification settings through the Discord app, which might cause them to only receive a notification badge and no push notification


###### Allowed Mention Types

| Type              | Value      | Description                           |
|-------------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Role Mentions     | "roles"    | Controls role mentions                |
| User Mentions     | "users"    | Controls user mentions                |
| Everyone Mentions | "everyone" | Controls @everyone and @here mentions |

###### Default Settings for Allowed Mentions

The default value for the `allowed_mentions` field, used when it is not passed in the body, varies depending on the context:

In **regular messages**, all mention types are parsed, which is equivalent to sending the following data:

```json
{
  "parse": ["users", "roles", "everyone"]
} 
```

In **interactions** and **webhooks**, only user mentions are parsed, which corresponds to the following:

```json
{
  "parse": ["users"]
} 
```

| users?        | array of snowflakes            | Array of user ids to mention, max 100                                                                                                |
| replied_user? | boolean                        | For replies, whether to mention the author of the message being replied to, defaults to false                                        |

###### Allowed Mentions Examples

Because the behavior of the `allowed_mentions` field is more complex than it seems, here's a set of examples:


In the following case, we are sending a regular message **without** configuring `allowed_mentions`. As a result, all included mentions will be parsed.

```json
{
  "content": "@here Hello <@&1234> and <@5678> 👋"
}
```

If you want to completely suppress all mentions in the message, you can configure the `allowed_mentions` field as we've documented above:

```json
{
  "content": "@here Hello <@&1234> and <@5678> 👋",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": []
  }
}
```


It is important to note that the `parse` field is **mutually exclusive** with the other fields. In the example below, only the `1234` role and the `5678` user mentions would be parsed, but **not** the `@here` at the beginning. Passing a falsy value such as `null` or an empty array into the `users` field does not trigger a validation error.

```json
{
  "content": "@here Hello <@&1234> and <@5678> 👋",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users", "roles"],
    "users": []
  }
}
```


In this next example, **only** `@everyone` would be parsed, as well as users `1234` and `5678` in case they suppressed `@everyone` mentions in their settings.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@1234> <@5678> <@&789> 👋",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["everyone"],
    "users": ["1234", "5678"]
  }
}
```


Due to possible ambiguities, not all configurations are accepted. Here's an example of an *invalid* configuration, because it includes both `parse` and `users`, despite those fields being mutually exclusive, causing a validation error.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@1234> <@5678> <@9012> <@&200>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users"],
    "users": ["1234", "5678"]
  }
}
```

Any entities whose id is included can be mentioned. Do note the API will silently ignore entities whose id are present in the `allowed_mentions` field, but not in the content of the message or its components. For example, in the following configuration, the user 123 mention would be parsed because it is present in the `content`. However, since there is no mention of user 456 in the `content`, they would not be notified.

```json
{
  "content": "<@123> Time for some memes 🤠",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "users": ["123", "456"]
  }
}
```

## Get Channel Messages
<Route method="GET">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)/messages</Route>

Retrieves the messages in a channel. Returns an array of [message](/docs/resources/message#message-object) objects from newest to oldest on success.

If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the current user to have the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission. If the channel is a voice channel, they must _also_ have the `CONNECT` permission.

If the current user is missing the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission in the channel, then no messages will be returned.

:::info
The `before`, `after`, and `around` parameters are mutually exclusive, only one may be passed at a time.

| after?  | snowflake | Get messages after this message ID       | absent  |
| limit?  | integer   | Max number of messages to return (1-100) | 50      |

## Get Channel Message
<Route method="GET">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)/messages/[\{message.id\}](/docs/resources/message#message-object)</Route>

Retrieves a specific message in the channel. Returns a [message](/docs/resources/message#message-object) object on success.

If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the current user to have the `VIEW_CHANNEL` and `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permissions. If the channel is a voice channel, they must _also_ have the `CONNECT` permission.

## Create Message
<Route method="POST">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)/messages</Route>

:::warn
Discord may strip certain characters from message content, like invalid unicode characters or characters which cause unexpected message formatting. If you are passing user-generated strings into message content, consider sanitizing the data to prevent unexpected behavior and using `allowed_mentions` to prevent unexpected mentions.
:::

Post a message to a guild text or DM channel. Returns a [message](/docs/resources/message#message-object) object. Fires a [Message Create](/docs/events/gateway-events#message-create) Gateway event. See [message formatting](/docs/reference#message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.

To create a message as a reply or forward of another message, apps can include a [`message_reference`](/docs/resources/message#message-reference-structure).
Refer to the documentation for required fields.

Files must be attached using a `multipart/form-data` body as described in [Uploading Files](/docs/reference#uploading-files).

###### Limitations

- When operating on a guild channel, the current user must have the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission.
- When sending a message with `tts` (text-to-speech) set to `true`, the current user must have the `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` permission.
- When creating a message as a reply to another message, the current user must have the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission.
    - The referenced message must exist and cannot be a system message.
- The maximum request size when sending a message is **25 MiB**
- For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.

## Delete All Reactions
<Route method="DELETE">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)/messages/[\{message.id\}](/docs/resources/message#message-object)/reactions</Route>

Deletes all reactions on a message. This endpoint requires the `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission to be present on the current user. Fires a [Message Reaction Remove All](/docs/events/gateway-events#message-reaction-remove-all) Gateway event.

## Delete All Reactions for Emoji
<Route method="DELETE">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)/messages/[\{message.id\}](/docs/resources/message#message-object)/reactions/[\{emoji.id\}](/docs/resources/emoji#emoji-object)</Route>

Deletes all the reactions for a given emoji on a message. This endpoint requires the `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission to be present on the current user. Fires a [Message Reaction Remove Emoji](/docs/events/gateway-events#message-reaction-remove-emoji) Gateway event.
The `emoji` must be [URL Encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) or the request will fail with `10014: Unknown Emoji`. To use custom emoji, you must encode it in the format `name:id` with the emoji name and emoji id.

## Edit Message
<Route method="PATCH">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)/messages/[\{message.id\}](/docs/resources/message#message-object)</Route>

Edit a previously sent message. The fields `content`, `embeds`, `flags` and `components` can be edited by the original message author. Other users can only edit `flags` and only if they have the `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission in the corresponding channel. When specifying flags, ensure to include all previously set flags/bits in addition to ones that you are modifying. Only `flags` documented in the table below may be modified by users (unsupported flag changes are currently ignored without error).

When the `content` field is edited, the arrays `mentions` and `mention_roles` and the boolean `mention_everyone` in the message object will be reconstructed from scratch based on the new content. When the message flag `IS_COMPONENTS_V2` is set, the reconstructed arrays and boolean are based on the edited content in the `components` array. The `allowed_mentions` field of the edit request controls how this happens. If there is no explicit `allowed_mentions` in the edit request, the content will be parsed with _default_ allowances, that is, without regard to whether or not an `allowed_mentions` was present in the request that originally created the message.

\* The `SUPPRESS_EMBEDS` flag can be both set and unset, while the `IS_COMPONENTS_V2` flag can only be set. When the `IS_COMPONENTS_V2` flag is set, any of the used `content`, `embeds`, `sticker_ids`, or `poll` fields must have their values reset to empty. For `content` and `poll` this is `null`. For `embeds` and `sticker_ids` this is `[]`. Failing to do this will result in a 400 BAD REQUEST response.
