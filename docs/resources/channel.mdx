###### Example Thread Channel

[Threads](/docs/topics/threads) can be either `archived` or `active`.  Archived threads are generally immutable.  To send a message or add a reaction, a thread must first be unarchived.  The API will helpfully automatically unarchive a thread when sending a message in that thread.

Unlike with channels, the API will only sync updates to users about threads the current user can view.  When receiving a [guild create](/docs/events/gateway-events#guild-create) payload, the API will only include active threads the current user can view.  Threads inside of private channels are completely private to the members of that private channel.  As such, when _gaining_ access to a channel the API sends a [thread list sync](/docs/events/gateway-events#thread-list-sync), which includes all active threads in that channel.

Threads also track membership.  Users must be added to a thread before sending messages in them.  The API will helpfully automatically add users to a thread when sending a message in that thread.

Guilds have limits on the number of active threads and members per thread.  Once these are reached additional threads cannot be created or unarchived, and users cannot be added.  Threads do not count against the per-guild channel limit.

The [threads](/docs/topics/threads) topic has some more information.

## Modify Channel
<Route method="PATCH">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)</Route>

###### JSON Params (Group DM)

Fires a [Channel Update](/docs/events/gateway-events#channel-update) Gateway event.

| Field | Type   | Description                  |
|-------|--------|------------------------------|
| name  | string | 1-100 character channel name |
| icon  | binary | base64 encoded icon          |

###### JSON Params (Guild channel)

Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild. Fires a [Channel Update](/docs/events/gateway-events#channel-update) Gateway event. If modifying a category, individual [Channel Update](/docs/events/gateway-events#channel-update) events will fire for each child channel that also changes. If modifying permission overwrites, the `MANAGE_ROLES` permission is required. Only permissions your bot has in the guild or parent channel (if applicable) can be allowed/denied (unless your bot has a `MANAGE_ROLES` overwrite in the channel).

###### JSON Params (Thread)

When setting `archived` to `false`, when `locked` is also `false`, only the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission is required.

Otherwise, requires the `MANAGE_THREADS` permission. Fires a [Thread Update](/docs/events/gateway-events#thread-update) Gateway event. Requires the thread to have `archived` set to `false` or be set to `false` in the request.

## Delete/Close Channel
<Route method="DELETE">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)</Route>

Delete a channel, or close a private message. Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild, or `MANAGE_THREADS` if the channel is a thread. Deleting a category does not delete its child channels; they will have their `parent_id` removed and a [Channel Update](/docs/events/gateway-events#channel-update) Gateway event will fire for each of them. Returns a [channel](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object) object on success. Fires a [Channel Delete](/docs/events/gateway-events#channel-delete) Gateway event (or [Thread Delete](/docs/events/gateway-events#thread-delete) if the channel was a thread).

:::warn
Deleting a guild channel cannot be undone. Use this with caution, as it is impossible to undo this action when performed on a guild channel. In contrast, when used with a private message, it is possible to undo the action by opening a private message with the recipient again.
:::

:::info
For Community guilds, the Rules or Guidelines channel and the Community Updates channel cannot be deleted.

Only permissions your bot has in the guild or parent channel (if applicable) can be allowed/denied (unless your bot has a `MANAGE_ROLES` overwrite in the channel). Returns a 204 empty response on success. Fires a [Channel Update](/docs/events/gateway-events#channel-update) Gateway event. For more information about permissions, see [permissions](/docs/topics/permissions#permissions).

## Group DM Remove Recipient
<Route method="DELETE">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)/recipients/[\{user.id\}](/docs/resources/user#user-object)</Route>

Removes a recipient from a Group DM.

## Start Thread from Message
<Route method="POST">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)/messages/[\{message.id\}](/docs/resources/message#message-object)/threads</Route>

Creates a new thread from an existing message. Returns a [channel](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object) on success, and a 400 BAD REQUEST on invalid parameters. Fires a [Thread Create](/docs/events/gateway-events#thread-create) and a [Message Update](/docs/events/gateway-events#message-update) Gateway event.

When called on a `GUILD_TEXT` channel, creates a `PUBLIC_THREAD`. When called on a `GUILD_ANNOUNCEMENT` channel, creates a `ANNOUNCEMENT_THREAD`. Does not work on a [`GUILD_FORUM`](/docs/resources/channel#start-thread-in-forum-or-media-channel) or a `GUILD_MEDIA` channel. The id of the created thread will be the same as the id of the source message, and as such a message can only have a single thread created from it.

## Start Thread in Forum or Media Channel
<Route method="POST">/channels/[\{channel.id\}](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object)/threads</Route>

Creates a new thread in a forum or a media channel, and sends a message within the created thread. Returns a [channel](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object), with a nested [message](/docs/resources/message#message-object) object, on success, and a 400 BAD REQUEST on invalid parameters. Fires a [Thread Create](/docs/events/gateway-events#thread-create) and [Message Create](/docs/events/gateway-events#message-create) Gateway event.

- The type of the created thread is `PUBLIC_THREAD`.
- See [message formatting](/docs/reference#message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.
- The current user must have the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission (`CREATE_PUBLIC_THREADS` is ignored).
- The maximum request size when sending a message is **25 MiB**.
- For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.
- Examples for file uploads are available in [Uploading Files](/docs/reference#uploading-files).
- Files must be attached using a `multipart/form-data` body as described in [Uploading Files](/docs/reference#uploading-files).
- Note that when sending a message, you must provide a value for at **least one of** `content`, `embeds`, `sticker_ids`, `components`, or `files[n]`.
