### Membership Screening Object

In guilds with [Membership Screening](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882) enabled, when a member joins, [Guild Member Add](/docs/topics/Gateway_Events#guild-member-add) will be emitted but they will initially be restricted from doing any actions in the guild, and `pending` will be true in the [member object](/docs/resources/Guild#guild-member-object). When the member completes the screening, [Guild Member Update](/docs/topics/Gateway_Events#guild-member-update) will be emitted and `pending` will be false.

:::warning
We are making significant changes to the Membership Screening API specifically related to getting and editing the Membership Screening object. Long story short is that it can be improved. As such, we have removed those documentation. There will **not be** any changes to how pending members work, as outlined above. That behavior will stay the same.

:::warning
When using the `roles` parameter, the first member of the array is used to change properties of the guild's `@everyone` role. If you are trying to bootstrap a guild with additional roles, keep this in mind.
:::

:::info
When using the `roles` parameter, the required `id` field within each role object is an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to [overwrite](/docs/resources/Channel#overwrite-object) a role's permissions in a channel when also passing in channels with the channels array.
:::

:::warning
When using the `channels` parameter, the `position` field is ignored, and none of the default channels are created.
:::

:::info
When using the `channels` parameter, the `id` field within each channel object may be set to an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to create `GUILD_CATEGORY` channels by setting the `parent_id` field on any children to the category's `id` field. Category channels must be listed before any children.
:::

:::warning
The `region` field is deprecated and is replaced by [channel.rtc_region](/docs/resources/Channel#channel-structure).

###### Example Partial Channel Object

###### Caveats

There are currently several caveats for this endpoint:

- current user must already have joined `channel_id`.
- You must have the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission to unsuppress yourself. You can always suppress yourself.
- You must have the `REQUEST_TO_SPEAK` permission to request to speak. You can always clear your own request to speak.
- You are able to set `request_to_speak_timestamp` to any present or future time.

## Modify User Voice State

| channel_id | snowflake | the id of the channel the user is currently in |
| suppress?  | boolean   | toggles the user's suppress state              |

###### Caveats

There are currently several caveats for this endpoint:

- `channel_id` must currently point to a stage channel.
- User must already have joined `channel_id`.
- You must have the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission. (Since suppression is the only thing that is available currently.)
- When unsuppressed, non-bot users will have their `request_to_speak_timestamp` set to the current time. Bot users will not.
