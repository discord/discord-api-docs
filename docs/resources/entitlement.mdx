## Consume an Entitlement
<Route method="POST">/applications/[\{application.id\}](/docs/resources/application#application-object)/entitlements/[\{entitlement.id\}](/docs/resources/entitlement#entitlement-object)/consume</Route>

For One-Time Purchase consumable SKUs, marks a given entitlement for the user as consumed. The entitlement will have `consumed: true` when using [List Entitlements](/docs/resources/entitlement#list-entitlements).

Returns a `204 No Content` on success.

## Create Test Entitlement
<Route method="POST">/applications/[\{application.id\}](/docs/resources/application#application-object)/entitlements</Route>

Creates a test entitlement to a given SKU for a given guild or user. Discord will act as though that user or guild has entitlement to your premium offering.

This endpoint returns a partial entitlement object. It will **not** contain `subscription_id`, `starts_at`, or `ends_at`, as it's valid in perpetuity.

After creating a test entitlement, you'll need to reload your Discord client. After doing so, you'll see that your server or user now has premium access.

Deletes a currently-active test entitlement. Discord will act as though that user or guild _no longer has_ entitlement to your premium offering.

Returns `204 No Content` on success.
