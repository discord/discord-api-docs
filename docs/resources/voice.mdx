###### Voice Region Structure

| Field      | Type    | Description                                                           |

| optimal    | boolean | true for a single server that is closest to the current user's client |
| deprecated | boolean | whether this is a deprecated voice region (avoid switching to these)  |
| custom     | boolean | whether this is a custom voice region (used for events/etc)           |

## List Voice Regions
<Route method="GET">/voice/regions</Route>

Returns an array of [voice region](/docs/resources/voice#voice-region-object) objects that can be used when setting a voice or stage channel's [`rtc_region`](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object-channel-structure).

## Get Current User Voice State
<Route method="GET">/guilds/[\{guild.id\}](/docs/resources/guild#guild-object)/voice-states/@me</Route>

Returns the current user's [voice state](/docs/resources/voice#voice-state-object) in the guild.

## Get User Voice State
<Route method="GET">/guilds/[\{guild.id\}](/docs/resources/guild#guild-object)/voice-states/[\{user.id\}](/docs/resources/user#user-object)</Route>

Returns the specified user's [voice state](/docs/resources/voice#voice-state-object) in the guild.

###### JSON Params

| Field                       | Type               | Description                                    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| channel_id?                 | snowflake          | the id of the channel the user is currently in |
| suppress?                   | boolean            | toggles the user's suppress state              |
| request_to_speak_timestamp? | ?ISO8601 timestamp | sets the user's request to speak               |

###### Caveats

There are currently several caveats for this endpoint:

- `channel_id` must currently point to a stage channel.
- current user must already have joined `channel_id`.
- You must have the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission to unsuppress yourself. You can always suppress yourself.
- You must have the `REQUEST_TO_SPEAK` permission to request to speak. You can always clear your own request to speak.
- You are able to set `request_to_speak_timestamp` to any present or future time.

## Modify User Voice State
<Route method="PATCH">/guilds/[\{guild.id\}](/docs/resources/guild#guild-object)/voice-states/[\{user.id\}](/docs/resources/user#user-object)</Route>

Updates another user's voice state. Returns `204 No Content` on success. Fires a [Voice State Update](/docs/events/gateway-events#voice-state-update) Gateway event.

###### JSON Params

| Field       | Type      | Description                                    |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| channel_id? | snowflake | the id of the channel the user is currently in |
| suppress?   | boolean   | toggles the user's suppress state              |

###### Caveats

There are currently several caveats for this endpoint:

- `channel_id` must currently point to a stage channel.
- User must already have joined `channel_id`.
- You must have the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission. (Since suppression is the only thing that is available currently.)
- When unsuppressed, non-bot users will have their `request_to_speak_timestamp` set to the current time. Bot users will not.
- When suppressed, the user will have their `request_to_speak_timestamp` removed.
