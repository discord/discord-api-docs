### Membership Screening Object

In guilds with [Membership Screening](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882) enabled, when a member joins, [Guild Member Add](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-member-add) will be emitted but they will initially be restricted from doing any actions in the guild, and `pending` will be true in the [member object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-member-object). When the member completes the screening, [Guild Member Update](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-member-update) will be emitted and `pending` will be false.

> warn
> We are making significant changes to the Membership Screening API specifically related to getting and editing the Membership Screening object. Long story short is that it can be improved. As such, we have removed those documentation. There will **not be** any changes to how pending members work, as outlined above. That behavior will stay the same.

## Create Guild % POST /guilds

Create a new guild. Returns a [guild](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/guild-object) object on success. Fires a [Guild Create](#DOCS_TOPICS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-create) Gateway event.

> warn
> This endpoint can be used only by bots in less than 10 guilds.

> warn

> info
> When using the `roles` parameter, the required `id` field within each role object is an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to [overwrite](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/overwrite-object) a role's permissions in a channel when also passing in channels with the channels array.
