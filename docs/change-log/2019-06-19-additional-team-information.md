Additional information around Teams has been added to both the API and the documentation. The [Teams](/docs/topics/teams#teams) page now includes information about the team and team member objects. Additionally, the [Get Current Application Information](/docs/topics/oauth2#get-current-bot-application-information) endpoint now returns a `team` object if that application belongs to a team. That documentation has also been updated to includes fields that were missing for applications that are games sold on Discord.
