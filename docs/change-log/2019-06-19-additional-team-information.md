Additional information around Teams has been added to both the API and the documentation. The [Teams](#DOCS_TOPICS_TEAMS/teams) page now includes information about the team and team member objects. Additionally, the [Get Current Application Information](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/get-current-bot-application-information) endpoint now returns a `team` object if that application belongs to a team. That documentation has also been updated to includes fields that were missing for applications that are games sold on Discord.
