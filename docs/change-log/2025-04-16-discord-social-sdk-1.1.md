- Added support for Unity Services as an external auth provider

### Voice
- [`Client::StartCallWithAudioCallbacks`] now permits sample data to be modified during record and 
  playback for custom effects processing
- Fixed a bug where the speaking state for a user could be stuck in the "on" state
- Added [`Call::GetPTTReleaseDelay`]
- Initialization of the voice engine is now delayed until it's needed
- Fixed a deadlock with the Linux PulseAudio backend where malfunctioning audio devices could cause a voice engine
  lockup

### Rich Presence

- Added support for sending rich presence updates and invites without connecting to the Discord gateway on desktop

### Misc

- Added Linux support for [`Client::RegisterLaunchCommand`] and
  [`Client::RegisterLaunchSteamApplication`]
- Fixed a crash when a Unity Editor scripting domain reload (e.g. entering/exiting play mode) happens while an async
  completion callback is pending
- Fixed [`Client::RemoveDiscordAndGameFriend`] only working if you're Discord friends
- Reduced some log spam from desktop client RPC message handling

The Discord Social SDK binaries are available for download in the Developer Portal after enabling the Discord Social SDK
