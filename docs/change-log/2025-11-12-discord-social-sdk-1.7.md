A new release of the Discord Social SDK is now available, with the following updates:

## Authentication

- Sign in with Apple and PlayStation Network are now supported as external identity providers.

## Linked Channels

- The results of [`Client::GetGuildChannels`] are now sorted in the order in which they appear in the Discord client. 
  Additional properties added to [`GuildChannel`] for type, position and parent category ID.

## PlayStation 5

- Added Low Energy Mode support. Explicit control of SDK thread affinity is provided by `cpuAffinityMask` property of [`ClientCreateOptions`].
- Fixed a crash when destroying and recreating [`Client`].

## Windows

- Fixed an issue which caused local crash dumps to be disabled in processes which load the Social SDK.

## Voice

- The Social SDK now uses our latest audio subsystem on Windows, bringing it more in line with the desktop client. Improves device compatibility and fixes some long-standing issues like Bluetooth devices changing profiles on startup.
- Desktop clients now use WebRTC m130 internally (upgraded from m116).
- Bug fixes and improvements to DAVE E2EE protocol implementation.
