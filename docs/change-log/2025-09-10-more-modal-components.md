We've added more components to modals! All select menus (User, Role, Mentionable, Channel) are now fully supported in modals. In order to use a select menu in a modal, it must be placed inside a [Label](/docs/components/reference#label) component. We've also added the [Text Display](/docs/components/reference#text-display) component with markdown support as a top-level component in modals.

#### Components Now Supported in Modals:

- [**User Select**](/docs/components/reference#user-select)
- [**Role Select**](/docs/components/reference#role-select)
- [**Mentionable Select**](/docs/components/reference#mentionable-select)
- [**Channel Select**](/docs/components/reference#channel-select)
- [**Text Display**](/docs/components/reference#text-display)
