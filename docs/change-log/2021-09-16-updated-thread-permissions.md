title: "Updated Thread Permissions"
date: "2021-09-16"

Thread permissions have been updated and simplified:

* "Use Public Threads" is now "Create Public Threads", which allows users to create public threads and announcement threads in a channel, even if they cannot send messages in that channel.
* "Use Private Threads" is now "Create Private Threads", which allows users to create private threads in a channel, even if they cannot send messages in that channel.

A new permission has also been added:

* "Send Messages in Threads", which allows users to send a message in a thread. The "Send Messages" permission has no effect in threads: users **must** have "Send Messages in Threads" to send a message in a thread. This allows for setups where a user can participate in a thread but cannot send a message in the parent channel (like a thread on an announcement post).
