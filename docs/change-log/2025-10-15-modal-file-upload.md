Have you ever wanted to collect more than text from a user through a modal? With the new [**File Upload**](/docs/components/reference#file-upload) component you can! You can specify a min and max number of files accepted between 0 and 10, and if uploading files within that limit is required before submitting. Any file types are accepted, and the max file size is based on the user's upload limit in that channel.

#### The New Component:

- [**File Upload**](/docs/components/reference#file-upload)

#### Developer Resources
