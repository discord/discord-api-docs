title: "Public Preview of OpenAPI 3.1 Specification"
date: "2023-08-02"

We're introducing an [OpenAPI 3.1 spec](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-spec) in public preview to make it easier and more reliable to develop with the HTTP API. While our current developer documentation requires manual reviews and updates, the OpenAPI spec is generated from the source code which means it better reflects the nooks, crannies, and nuances of the Discord API.

> warn
> The public preview of the OpenAPI spec is subject to breaking changes without advance notice, and should not be used within production environments. If you see something that looks incorrect or can be improved, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-spec/issues).

The public spec can be found in the new [`discord-api-spec` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-spec).
