A new release of the Discord Social SDK is now available, with the following updates:

## New Features

This small update to v1.6 adds some highly requested features from our partners. We found some time to sneak them in…

- You can now provide custom art to display as a banner image in game invites that appear in Discord. This is done one
  of two ways:
    - By specifying a URL or an `asset key` to an image in the `activity.assets.inviteCoverImage` parameter when
      calling `Client::UpdateRichPresence`. This method even affords you the ability to set a unique image
      on each invite if you want!
    - By uploading cover image art in the `Rich Presence` tab in the Developer Portal for your Application. Note: This
      will be used as the fallback image if you don’t specify one via `activity.assets.inviteCoverImage`
- It’s now possible to customize the displayed name for your Application in Discord’s Rich Presence. To do so, set
  the `activity.name` parameter when calling [`Client::UpdateRichPresence`]
- Added support for Microsoft Xbox GDK version 2025.04
- Fixed a crash when calling [`Client::GetUserGuilds`] on iOS devices
