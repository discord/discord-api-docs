You can now select roles other than admin when inviting users or configuring members of a team. There are four [role types](/docs/topics/teams#team-member-roles-team-member-role-types) that a team member can be assigned: owner, admin, developer, or read-only. The team member object now has an additional [`role` field](/docs/topics/teams#data-models-team-member-object), which is a string representing the member's current role.

Details about team member roles are in the updated [Teams documentation](/docs/topics/teams#team-member-roles).
