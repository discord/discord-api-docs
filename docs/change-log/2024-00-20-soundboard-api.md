[Soundboard](/docs/resources/soundboard) is now available in the API! Apps can now [get](/docs/resources/soundboard#list-default-soundboard-sounds) soundboard sounds, [modify](/docs/resources/soundboard#modify-guild-soundboard-sound) them, [send](/docs/resources/soundboard#send-soundboard-sound) them in voice channels, and listen to other users playing them!
