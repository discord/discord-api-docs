Ask to Join no longer requires approval or whitelisting to use. You are welcome to create in-game UI, but all Ask to Join requests are also now handled by the Discord overlay.

There have also been some small additions to the Rich Presence SDK. The previously undocumented `UpdateHandlers()` function is now documented.
