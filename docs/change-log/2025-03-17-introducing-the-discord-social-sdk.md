Developers can now use the Discord Social SDK to build social features into their games, enabling friends lists, cross-platform messaging, voice and more for all players — with or without a Discord account.

Discord Social SDK offers features that enhance connectivity and player engagement, including:

- Account Linking
- Provisional Accounts
- Rich Presence
- Deeplink Game Invites

Additionally, available in a closed beta to support in-game communications:

- Cross-Platform Messaging
- Linked Channels
- Voice Chat

Developers can request expanded access to these available features via the closed beta.
