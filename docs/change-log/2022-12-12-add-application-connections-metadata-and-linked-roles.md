Introducing [linked roles](https://discord.com/blog/connected-accounts-functionality-boost-linked-roles) as well as the ability for all developers to set up their own linked roles with an application. This includes:

* New [`role_connections_verification_url`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION/application-object) that can be set in the developer portal in order for the application to render as potential verification option for linked roles.
* [Application metadata](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION_ROLE_CONNECTION_METADATA/application-role-connection-metadata-object) to specify more detailed linked role requirements.
* New endpoints to [retrieve](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION_ROLE_CONNECTION_METADATA/get-application-role-connection-metadata-records) (`GET /applications/<application.id>/role-connections/metadata`) and [update](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION_ROLE_CONNECTION_METADATA/update-application-role-connection-metadata-records) (`PUT /applications/<application.id>/role-connections/metadata`) application connection metadata.
* New [`role_connections.write`](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) OAuth2 scope required to authenticate the below requests.
* Endpoints to [retrieve](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/get-current-user-application-role-connection) (`GET /users/@me/applications/{application.id}/role-connection`) and [update](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/update-current-user-application-role-connection) (`PUT /users/@me/applications/{application.id}/role-connection`) a user's role connections, both of which return an [application role connection](#DOCS_RESOURCES_USER/application-role-connection-object) object.
