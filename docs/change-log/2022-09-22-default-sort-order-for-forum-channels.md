`default_sort_order` is an optional field in the [channel object](/docs/resources/channel) that indicates how the threads in a [forum channel](/docs/topics/threads#forums) will be sorted for users by default. Setting `default_sort_order` requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission.

If `default_sort_order` hasn't been set, its value will be `null`.
