`default_sort_order` is an optional field in the [channel object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL) that indicates how the threads in a [forum channel](#DOCS_TOPICS_THREADS/forums) will be sorted for users by default. Setting `default_sort_order` requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission.

If `default_sort_order` hasn't been set, its value will be `null`.
