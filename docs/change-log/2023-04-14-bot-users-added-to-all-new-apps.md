Starting today, [bot users](/docs/topics/oauth2#bot-vs-user-accounts) will be added to all newly-created apps. Settings and configuration options for bot users remain the same, and can still be accessed on the **Bot** page within your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

If your app doesn't need or want a bot user associated with it, you can refrain from adding the [`bot` scope](/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) when installing your app.
