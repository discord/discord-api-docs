Starting today, [bot users](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/bot-vs-user-accounts) will be added to all newly-created apps. Settings and configuration options for bot users remain the same, and can still be accessed on the **Bot** page within your [app's settings](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

If your app doesn't need or want a bot user associated with it, you can refrain from adding the [`bot` scope](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) when installing your app.
