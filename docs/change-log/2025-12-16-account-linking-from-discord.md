We've added a new guide showing how to enable account linking entry points within the Discord client. With Social SDK 1.6+, Discord can now display "Link your account" prompts and buttons throughout the client to encourage players to connect their game accounts, leading to higher linking rates and better social engagement.

The guide covers two implementation flows:

- **Connected Game Flow (recommended)**: Uses new callback methods to launch account linking directly in your game when players click Discord's entry points
- **Web Flow**: Routes players through a web-based OAuth flow (currently only available for select partners)
