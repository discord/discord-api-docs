A new release of the Discord Social SDK is now available, with the following updates:

### Moderation Metadata Support

- [Coming Soon] Messages will soon support [`MessageHandle::ModerationMetadata`], a set of custom string key-value pairs that can be used
  to communicate moderation-related information between your game backend and client.
    - This SDK version includes the functionality to support this upcoming feature, but it will only become available
      after an upcoming Discord API change.

### WebSocket Reporting

- WebSocket connection failures will now report an HTTP status code to the SDK log.

### PlayStation 5

- Improved accuracy of timing metrics used for monitoring the health of connections and voice calls.
