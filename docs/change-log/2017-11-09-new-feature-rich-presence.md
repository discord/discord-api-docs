Rich Presence is now live and available for all developers! Rich Presence allows developers to closely integrate with Discord in a number of new, cool ways like:

* Showing more information about a user's current game in their profile
* Allowing users to post invitations to join their party or spectate their game in chat
* Displaying "Spectate" and "Ask to Join" buttons on users' profiles

For more information, check out our [Rich Presence site](https://discord.com/rich-presence). To get started on development, [read the docs](/docs/rich-presence/overview)!
