Forum channels ([`GUILD_FORUM` or `15`](/docs/resources/channel#channel-object-channel-types)) have been released to all community servers. `GUILD_FORUM` channels are a new channel type that only supports threads, which display differently than in text (`GUILD_TEXT`) channels.

Check out the [forums topic](/docs/topics/threads#forums) for more information on the relevant APIs and technical details, and the [Forums FAQ](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079#h_01JAZAWCX4DXYK26BKT49DXMAQ) for more about the feature.
