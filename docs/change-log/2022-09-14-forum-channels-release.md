Forum channels ([`GUILD_FORUM` or `15`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-channel-types)) have been released to all community servers. `GUILD_FORUM` channels are a new channel type that only supports threads, which display differently than in text (`GUILD_TEXT`) channels.

Check out the [forums topic](#DOCS_TOPICS_THREADS/forums) for more information on the relevant APIs and technical details, and the [Forums FAQ](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6208479917079-Forum-Channels-FAQ#h_01G69FJQWTWN88HFEHK7Z6X79N) for more about the feature.
