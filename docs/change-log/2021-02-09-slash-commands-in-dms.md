Slash Commands are now supported in DMs with bots. Due to this change, some of the fields on the [Interaction object](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-structure) have been made optional. Newly optional fields don't reflect any behavior changes in Slash Commands within guilds; they are to support commands in the context of a DM only.
