We've added new functionality to Rich Presences to give users of your application a more interactive and flexible experience. There are two big changes as part of this:
- You can now add clickable links to the state text, details text, large image & small image
- You can now choose which field (name, state, or details) is used in users' status text in the member list (e.g. instead of "Listening to MyMusic" you can now have your status text show "Listening to Rick Astley")

All of these new fields are documented on the [Activity Object](/docs/events/gateway-events#activity-object) section of Gateway Events and also available through the Embedded App SDK.
