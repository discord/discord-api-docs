title: "API v10"
date: "2022-02-14"
---

* API v8 is now deprecated.
* `GET /channels/{channel.id}/threads/active` is decommissioned in favor of [`GET /guilds/{guild.id}/threads/active`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/list-active-guild-threads).
* Starting in v10, you must specify the message content intent (`1 << 15`) to receive content-related fields in message dispatches. Read more in the [Gateway Intents documentation](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents).
* To specify a reason for an administrative action in audit logs, apps must now pass the `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header rather than the `reason` parameter for all endpoints. Read more in the [Audit Logs documentation](#DOCS_RESOURCES_AUDIT_LOG).
* Message routes (like [`POST /channels/{channel.id}/messages`](#DOCS_RESOURCES_MESSAGE/create-message)) now use the `embeds` field (an array of embed objects) instead of `embed`.
* The `summary` field for [applications](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION) now returns an empty string for all API versions.
* The `name` and `description` fields for [Achievements](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/docs/game_sdk/Achievements.md#achievement-struct) are now strings, and localization info is now passed in new `name_localizations` and `description_localizations` dictionaries. This change standardizes localization to match [Application Commands](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_APPLICATION_COMMANDS/localization). Read details in the [Achievements documentation](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/docs/game_sdk/Achievements.md#achievement-struct).
* Existing attachments must be specified when [`PATCH`ing messages with new attachments](#DOCS_REFERENCE/editing-message-attachments). Any attachments not specified will be removed and replaced with the specified list
* Requests to v10 and higher will no longer be supported on `discordapp.com` (this does **not** affect `cdn.discordapp.com`)

#### Upcoming changes

* API v6 and v7 will be decommissioned **in early 2023**
