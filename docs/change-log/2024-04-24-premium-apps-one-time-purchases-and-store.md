Two new features are now available for Premium Apps: One-Time Purchases and Stores.

**One-Time Purchases**

* **Durable Items**: A one-time purchase that is permanent and is not subject to either renewal or consumption, such as lifetime access to an app's premium features.
* **Consumable Items**: A one-time, non-renewable purchase that provides access, such as a temporary power-up or boost in a game.

Learn more about [Implementing One-Time Purchases](/docs/monetization/implementing-one-time-purchases).

**A Store for Your Premium App**

We have also introduced a Store for your Premium App to showcase your app subscriptions and one-time purchase items. You can now create a unique Store page within the developer portal and add your published subscription SKUs or one-time purchase SKUs to your store view, allowing your users to buy these items from your App Directory or Bot User Profile.

To explore these features, eligibility details, and how to enable monetization for your app, check out the [Monetization Overview](/docs/monetization/overview).
