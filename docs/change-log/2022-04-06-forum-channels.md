Added new channel type, `GUILD_FORUM` (15). A `GUILD_FORUM` channel is an unreleased feature that is very similar (from an API perspective) to a `GUILD_TEXT` channel, except only threads can be created in that channel; messages cannot be sent directly in that channel. Check out the [forums topic](/docs/topics/threads#forums) for more information.
