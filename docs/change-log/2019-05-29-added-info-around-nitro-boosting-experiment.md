Additional information has been documented to support [Server Nitro Boosting](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting). This includes the addition of a few [message types](/docs/resources/message#message-object-message-types), as well as some [new fields on guilds](/docs/resources/guild#guild-object-premium-tier). Please note that this feature is currently under experimentation, and these fields may be subject to change.
