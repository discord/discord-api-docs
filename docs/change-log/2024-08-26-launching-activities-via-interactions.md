[Activities](/docs/activities/overview) can now be launched as a response to interactions using the `LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` (type `12`) [interaction callback type](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-type). `LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` can be used in response to `APPLICATION_COMMAND`, `MESSAGE_COMPONENT`, and `MODAL_SUBMIT` [interaction types](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object-interaction-type).
