We have added a global rate limit for API requests made to `discordapp.com/*` and may further restrict requests in the future.

To limit impact on your app, please make sure you are making calls to `discord.com/*`.

This does **not** apply for `cdn.discordapp.com`.

Refer to the [API Reference](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference) for more info on which url(s) to use when building on the REST API

* [February 14, 2022 Change Log](https://discord.com/developers/docs/change-log#feb-14-2022): Requests to v10 and higher will no longer be supported on `discordapp.com` (this does not affect `cdn.discordapp.com`)
