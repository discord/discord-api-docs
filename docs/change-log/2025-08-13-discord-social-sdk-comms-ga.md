### Discord Social SDK Communication Features - General Availability

Communication features (cross-platform messaging, voice chat, lobbies, and linked channels) are now generally available for all Discord
Social SDK users that meet our application process criteria. Previously available only in closed beta, these features 
enable seamless player interaction within your game.

* **Direct Messages**: One-on-one private chat functionality
* **Discord voice chat**: Real-time voice communication inside game lobbies
* **Lobbies & In-Game text chat**: Virtual spaces where players can interact through voice and text chat
* **Linked Channels**: Integration with Discord's server-based text channels directly in your game UI

### New Application Process for Full Access

We've launched an application process for developers who want to remove rate limits and gain production level access to communication features. Developers can now apply through our developer portal with detailed game information and usage projections to unlock production-level capacity.

As part of documenting this application process, we have also documented pre-approval rate limits, so you can build, test and develop against the Social SDK with confidence.

### Get Started with the Social SDK

The Discord Social SDK binaries are available for download in the Developer Portal after enabling the Discord Social SDK for your application.
