A new release of the Discord Social SDK is now available, with the following updates:

### ‚ú®¬†New Features

- When calling [`Client::GetGuildChannels`], channels are now sorted by their `position` field, which matches how they are sorted in the Discord client.
- Messages received via the Social SDK, no longer create notifications in a Discord client for the same user, to avoid double notification on the same machine.

**This release adds features to support upcoming Discord experiments that will enhance how games integrate with user profiles and authentication:**

- **Game Profile Integration**: New functionality to display game data on Discord user profiles. This includes `UserApplicationProfile` support with two new methods: [`Client::GetUserApplicationProfiles`] and [`Client::GetUserApplicationProfilesNoLock`] on the Users class, which retrieve game identity data from external authentication providers.
- **In-Discord Authentication Flow**: Support for users to start account linking directly from Discord (rather than having to initiate it from within your game). Added [`Client::RegisterAuthorizeRequestCallback`] and [`Client::RemoveAuthorizeRequestCallback`] methods to handle authentication requests that originate from various Discord entry points. These functions support upcoming Discord client experiments that will be gradually rolled out to users over time.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è¬†Deprecations

This deprecation aims to improve consistence across the SDK‚Äôs API surface as well as provide a safer implementation that has fewer edge cases and less potential for accidental misuse.

- Deprecated¬†[`Client::GetCurrentUser`]¬†API in favor of¬†[`Client::GetCurrentUserV2`]¬†which returns optional values instead of potentially invalid handles.

### üöÄ Performance Improvements

- This update implements caching capabilities for the [`Client::GetUserMessagesWithLimit`] function to avoid unnecessary remote API calls when sufficient messages are already cached locally.

### üé§¬†Voice Communications Fixes and Improvements

Fixes several critical bugs with the voice communications system, as well as improved overall reliability, and noise and echo suppression and cancellation.

- Fixed an issue where voice calls would sometimes transition to `Disconnected` state instead of reconnecting properly after a network interruption.
- Extended AGC2 (Automatic Gain Control 2) support to mobile platforms

### üêõ¬†General Stability and Bug Fixes

Multiple general critical bugs that can cause crashes and panics. We highly recommend upgrading to 1.6 to avoid them in your game.

- Fixed critical bug where activity party privacy wasn't properly set, causing "ask to join" to appear instead of "join" for public parties.
- Fixed critical memory safety issue preventing connection objects from being deallocated during timer callbacks.
- Fixed C# marshaling alignment bugs and double-free crashes.
- Improved gateway resilience with fallback to generic URLs on zonal gateway failures.
- Fixed WebSocket write-after-close errors preventing connection issues.
