API v9 is now available.

API v9 includes support for [threads](#DOCS_TOPICS_THREADS), an upcoming feature.  Older API versions will not receive any Gateway Events for threads, so it is important to update soon!  We've prepared a [migration guide](#DOCS_TOPICS_THREADS) to help make the upgrade process very straightforward.

This documentation is being published early so bots can have at least two months to upgrade before threads launch.

Additionally, API v9 also removes the `/channels/:id/messages/:id/suppress-embeds` route.
