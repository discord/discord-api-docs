[User commands](/docs/interactions/application-commands#user-commands) and [message commands](/docs/interactions/application-commands#message-commands) are now live! These commands appear on context menus for users and messages, with more to come in the future.

Context menu commands are a type of application command. The "Slash Commands" documentation page has been renamed to "Application Commands" and split out by type to show this.
