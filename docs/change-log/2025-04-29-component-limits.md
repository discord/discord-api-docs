We're removing the top level component limit and raising the limit on number of components in a message to 40 when using the [`IS_COMPONENTS_V2` message flag](/docs/resources/message#message-object-message-flags)! We're also removing the limit on the number of components in a [Container Component](/docs/components/reference#container). Legacy messages have not changed and continue to allow up to 5 action rows.

#### What's New

- **Total components**: The limit for total components in a message has been increased to 40.
- **Top-level components**: There is no longer a limit on top level components in a message (previously it was 10).
- **[Container Component](/docs/components/reference#container)**: There is no longer a limit on the number of components in a Container Component (previously it was 10).
