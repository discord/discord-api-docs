We've shipped some updates to the GameSDK, including support for Linux as well as the IL2CPP backend system for Unity. These changes also fixed a bug in the [`SetUserAchievement()`](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/docs/game_sdk/Achievements.md#setuserachievement) method.

Get the latest at the top of the [Getting Started](/docs/developer-tools/game-sdk#step-1-get-the-sdk) documentation. If you're looking for help interacting with the GameSDK or want to report a bug, join us on the [official Discord](https://discord.gg/discord-developers).
