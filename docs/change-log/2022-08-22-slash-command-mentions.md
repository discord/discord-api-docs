This week, [Slash Command mentions](#DOCS_REFERENCE/message-formatting) are rolling out across all Discord clients (for Android, mentions are limited to the [React Native client](https://discord.com/blog/android-react-native-framework-update)). Clicking a Slash Command mention will auto-populate the command in the user's message input.

Slash Command mentions use the following format: `</NAME:COMMAND_ID>`. You can also use `</NAME SUBCOMMAND:ID>` and `</NAME SUBCOMMAND_GROUP SUBCOMMAND:ID>` for subcommands and subcommand groups.
