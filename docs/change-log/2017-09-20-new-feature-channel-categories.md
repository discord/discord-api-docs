Changes have been made throughout the documentation to reflect the addition of channel categories to Discord. These includes an additional field—`parent_id`—to the base [channel](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object) object and a new [channel category example](#DOCS_RESOURCES_CHANNEL/channel-object-example-channel-category).
