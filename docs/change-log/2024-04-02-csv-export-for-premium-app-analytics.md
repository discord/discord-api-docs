For apps with [Monetization](/docs/monetization/overview) enabled, we have released the ability to export your SKU analytics to CSV. These exports allow you to use your preferred data tools to report on your premium offerings.

You can find the export at the bottom of the `Monetization → Analytics` tab of your app to export data points such as `sales_count`, `sales_amount`, `sales_currencies`, `cancellation_count`, `refund_amount`, and `refund_count`, aggregated by each of your offerings for the selected month.
