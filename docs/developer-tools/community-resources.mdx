# Community Resources

Our community members create amazing tools and resources that help developers build and maintain their apps. From permissions calculators and embed visualizers to comprehensive libraries for interfacing with our API, our community has built a wealth of resources to make your development process smoother and more efficient.

## Discord Developers

The [Official Discord Developers server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers) is a developer ran, but community driven, support hub. If you need help with developing something on Discord or want official updates from the developers, this is the place to be.

## Libraries

Discord does not maintain official SDKs.  The following table is an inexhaustive list of third-party libraries that have valid rate limit implementations, are recently maintained, and have large communities of active bots.

## Interactions

[Interactions](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding) are the great, new way of making a Discord bot. The following open-source libraries provide help for the security and authentication checks that are mandatory if you are receiving Interactions via outgoing webhook. They also include some types for the Interactions data models.

## OpenAPI Specification

:::warn
The OpenAPI spec is currently in public preview and **is subject to breaking changes**
:::

The public preview of the [Discord HTTP API specification](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-spec) provides a standard [OpenAPI 3.1 spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md) for the HTTP API.

## Permission Calculators

[Permissions](/docs/topics/permissions#permissions) in Discord are tricky. Luckily, we've got really smart people who love us and have made some great permissions calculators. If you're making a bot for others, and you're not sure how to properly calculate permissions or generate your [authorization URL](/docs/topics/oauth2#bot-authorization-flow), these are great tools:

- [BotForge's Permissions Calculator](https://tools.botforge.org/permissions)
- [FiniteReality's Permissions Calculator](https://finitereality.github.io/permissions-calculator/?v=0)
- [abalabahaha's Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#0)

## Intent Calculators

[Gateway Intents](/docs/events/gateway#gateway-intents) are pretty confusing at first. If you're not sure what to send in your [Identify payload](/docs/events/gateway-events#identify), then these tools may be of help:

- [ziad87's Intent Calculator](https://ziad87.net/intents/)
- [Larko's Intent Calculator](https://discord-intents-calculator.vercel.app/)

## Embed Visualizers

Webhooks and embeds might seem like black magic. That's because they are, but let us help you demystify them a bit. These tools can help you test how embeds will appear inside of Discord:

- [JohnyTheCarrot's Embed Previewer](https://github.com/JohnyTheCarrot/discord-embed-previewer) (Browser Extension)

## API Types

If you're working on a project that interacts with our API, you might find an API types module useful as it provides type inspection/completion for the Discord API.

| Name                                                                | Language   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| [dasgo](https://github.com/switchupcb/dasgo)                        | Go         |
| [discord-api-types](https://github.com/discordjs/discord-api-types) | JavaScript |

## Game SDK Tools

Discord Game SDK's lobby and networking layer shares similarities with other gaming platforms (i.e. Valve's Steamworks SDK). The following open source library provides developers a uniform interface for these shared features and can simplify developing for multiple platforms. Note: this library is tailored for Unity3D development.
