title: "Gateway v6 Intent Restrictions"

The v6 gateway now applies the restrictions for gateway intents. This means the new chunking limitations are now in effect, regardless of intents being used. See [Request Guild Members](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/request-guild-members) for further details.
Additionally, if privileged intents are not enabled in the application dashboard the bot will not receive the events for those intents.

All other intents are always enabled by default unless specified otherwise by the identify payload. We have made a support article to explain some of the changes and resulting issues with more details: [Gateway Update FAQ](https://dis.gd/gwupdate)
