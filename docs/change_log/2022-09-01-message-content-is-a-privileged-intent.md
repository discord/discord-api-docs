As of today, [message content](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY/message-content-intent) is a privileged intent for all verified apps *and* apps eligible for verification. More details about why it's becoming a privileged intent and how to apply for it is in the [Help Center FAQ](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Privileged-Intent-FAQ).

Any app that does not have the message content intent configured in its app's settings within the Developer Portal will receive empty values in fields that expose message content across Discord's APIs (including the `content`, `embeds`, `attachments`, and `components` fields). These restrictions do not apply for messages that a bot or app sends, in DMs that it receives, or in messages in which it is mentioned.

#### If your app is verified

Verified apps and verification-eligible apps must be approved for the message content intent to receive message content. If your verified app isn’t approved, or doesn’t account for the new message content restrictions, it will break for users.

##### Temporary Message Content Intent

Verified apps or apps that have submitted for verification can temporarily opt-in to a grace period which will allow your app to continue receiving message content until October 1.  However, if you opt-in to the grace period, your app will be prevented from joining any additional servers until you opt-out. More details are in the [Help Center article](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8561391080471).

#### If your app is unverified

Unverified apps must still must enable the intent in your app’s settings within the Developer Portal.

Existing unverified apps will automatically have the message content intent toggled on in their settings. New unverified apps will have to manually toggle the intent in the Developer Portal.
