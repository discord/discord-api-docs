Inline Replies have been added to our documentation. They behave differently in v6 and v8, so be cautious in your implementation:

* Inline replies are type `19` in v8, but remain type `0` in v6
* You can now add a `message_reference` on message create to create a reply
* A new field `referenced_message` has been added to the [Message Object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_MESSAGE/message-object)
* A new field `replied_user` has been added to the [Allowed Mentions Object](#DOCS_RESOURCES_MESSAGE/allowed-mentions-object)
* [Message Create](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/message-create) gateway event is guaranteed to have a `referenced_message` if the message created is a reply. Otherwise, that field is not guaranteed.
