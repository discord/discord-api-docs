title: Changes to Slash Command Response Types and Flags
date: 2022-03-05

Changes to interaction response types have been made to support better designs for application commands:

- Type `2` `Acknowledge` has been deprecated
- Type `3` `ChannelMessage` has been deprecated
- Type `5` `AcknowledgeWithSource` has been renamed to `DeferredChannelMessageWithSource`

These deprecated types will be removed and break on **April 9, 2021**.

Additionally, `flags` has been documented on [InteractionApplicationCommandCallbackData](#DOCS_INTERACTIONS_RECEIVING_AND_RESPONDING/interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-data-structure). Setting `flags` to `64` will make the interaction response ephemeral.
