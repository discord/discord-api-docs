We've added documentation around a brand new feature: [Gateway Intents!](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY/gateway-intents) Gateway Intents are a great way to specify which events you want to receive from our gateway. Go on, save yourself some bandwidth and CPU usage.

Using Intents will change the behavior of some existing events and commands, so please refer to:

* [Guild Create](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-create)
* [Request Guild Members](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/request-guild-members)
* [Guild Member Add](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-member-add)
* [Guild Member Remove](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-member-remove)
* [Guild Member Update](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/guild-member-update)
* [Presence Update](#DOCS_EVENTS_GATEWAY_EVENTS/presence-update)
* [List Guild Members](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/list-guild-members)
