## 1. Add Value for the Player

This integration aims to bring value to the player's gaming experience. Branded connection points should highlight said value-add based on the context.

## 2. Foster trust with Discord's brand 

Lean into Discord's visual-styling to establish trust through brand recognition. The more players that connect, the more robust the social graph is for the game.

## 3. Promote Understanding through consistency

Use consistent branding and user-flows across games to build expected behavior. We care about the UX, not the UI.

## 4. Prioritize the player's immersion

Our focus is on preserving the player's immersion in the game. There are no requirements to replicate Discord's UI. The visual-design should feel as seamlessly integrated into the game as our SDKs.

## 5. Uphold data privacy, transparency, and control

Each platform is in control and responsible for the data on their respective platforms. Players are informed of where their data shows up.
