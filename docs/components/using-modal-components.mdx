## Displaying a Modal

Displaying a modal can be done in response to an [interaction](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding). When displaying a modal you'll use an [interaction response](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object) with the [`MODAL`](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-type) interaction callback type and [modal fields](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-modal).

An example of a modal with a [String Select](/docs/components/reference#string-select) and [Text Input](/docs/components/reference#text-input) both wrapped in [Labels](/docs/components/reference#label):

```json
{
  "type": 9,
  "data": {
    "custom_id": "bug_modal",
    "title": "Bug Report",
    "components": [
      {
        "type": 18,
        "label": "What's your favorite bug?",
        "component": {
          "type": 3,
          "custom_id": "bug_string_select",
          "placeholder": "Choose...",
          "options": [
            {
              "label": "Ant",
              "value": "ant",
              "description": "(best option)",
              "emoji": {
                "name": "üêú"
              }
            },
            {
              "label": "Butterfly",
              "value": "butterfly",
              "emoji": {
                "name": "ü¶ã"
              }
            },
            {
              "label": "Caterpillar",
              "value": "caterpillar",
              "emoji": {
                "name": "üêõ"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "type": 18,
        "label": "Why is it your favorite?",
        "description": "Please provide as much detail as possible!",
        "component": {
          "type": 4,
          "custom_id": "bug_explanation",
          "style": 2,
          "min_length": 1000,
          "max_length": 4000,
          "placeholder": "Write your explanation here...",
          "required": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
