# Using Modal Components

## Overview

Modal components are a great way to collect freeform information from your users. 

:::info
Currently, only [Text Input](/docs/components/reference#text-input) fields are supported in a modal, and each one must be placed in an [Action Row](/docs/components/reference#action-row).
:::

### Prerequisites

- You must have a Discord account and be a member of the Discord Developer Portal.
- You must have a Discord application created in the Discord Developer Portal.

## Displaying a Modal

Displaying a modal can be done in response to a [slash command](/docs/tutorials/upgrading-to-application-commands#slash-commands) or when responding to an [interaction](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding). When displaying a modal you'll use an [interaction response](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object) with the [`MODAL`](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-interaction-callback-type) interaction callback type and [modal fields](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-response-object-modal).

An example of a modal with two Text Inputs:

```json
{
    "type": 9,
    "data": {
        "custom_id": "feedback_modal",
        "title": "Submit Feedback",
        "components": [
            {
                "type": 1,
                "components": [
                    {
                        "type": 4,
                        "custom_id": "feedback_subject",
                        "label": "Subject",
                        "style": 1,
                        "min_length": 1,
                        "max_length": 100,
                        "placeholder": "What is your feedback about?",
                        "required": true
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "type": 1,
                "components": [
                    {
                        "type": 4,
                        "custom_id": "feedback_details",
                        "label": "Details",
                        "style": 2,
                        "min_length": 10,
                        "max_length": 1000,
                        "placeholder": "Please provide details...",
                        "required": true
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
