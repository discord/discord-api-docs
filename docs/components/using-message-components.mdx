# Using Message Components

## Overview 

Message components are a powerful way to add interactivity to your messages. They allow you to create rich, interactive experiences for your users, making it easier for them to engage with your content.

:::info
If you are sending components as part of a [webhook](/docs/resources/webhook) you'll need to use the [`?with_components=true`](/docs/resources/webhook#execute-webhook-query-string-params) query param otherwise they'll be ignored.
:::

### Prerequisites

- You must have a Discord account and be a member of the Discord Developer Portal.
- You must have a Discord application created in the Discord Developer Portal.
- You must have the necessary permissions to send messages in the channel where you want to use components.

## Sending a Message with a Component

To send a message with a component, you need to set the `IS_COMPONENTS_V2` flag (`1<<15`) in your message's `flags` field. This can be done when using [Message Create](/docs/resources/message#create-message), [Execute Webhook](/docs/resources/webhook#execute-webhook), or [responding to an interaction](/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#create-followup-message).

This flag indicates that the message contains components and disables traditional content and embeds.

All content must be sent as components instead of using the standard message format.

```json
{
  "flags": 32768,
  "components": [
    {
      "type": 10,
      "content": "This is a message using the Text Display component"
    },
  ]
}
```

## Sending a Message with Multiple Components

To send a message with multiple components, you can include multiple component objects in your message's `components` field. This field allows you to specify an array of components that will be included in the message.

```json
{
  "flags": 32768,
  "components": [
    {
      "type": 10,
      "content": "This is a Text Display component."
    },
    {
      "type": 10,
      "content": "This is another Text Display component!"
    },
  ]
}
```

## Nesting Components with Layout Components

You can also nest components within layout components. This gives you more flexibility in displaying information, images, and interactive components to your users. Check out the [list of components](/docs/components/reference#component-object-component-types) for a complete list of available layout components.

For example, you can create a message with an Action Row component that contains multiple Button components.

```json
{
  "flags": 32768,
  "components": [
    {
      "type": 10,
      "content": "This is a message with v2 components"
    },
    {
      "type": 1,
      "components": [
        {
          "type": 2,
          "style": 1,
          "label": "Click Me",
          "custom_id": "click_me_1"
        },
        {
          "type": 2,
          "style": 2,
          "label": "Click Me Too",
          "custom_id": "click_me_2"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using Message Components with Interactions

When a user interacts with an interactive message component, your app will [receive an interaction event](/docs/interactions/overview). This event contains information about the interaction, including the type of interaction and the component that was interacted with.

See the [list of supported component types](/docs/components/reference#component-object-component-types) for a list of interactive message components and their interaction event payloads.

You can use this information to respond to the interaction, update the message, or perform other actions, such as displaying a modal based on the user's input.

Check out the [Interactions documentation](/docs/interactions/overview) for more information on handling interactions and responding to user input from interactive components.
