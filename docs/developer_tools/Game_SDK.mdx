# Game SDK

Welcome to the documentation for the Discord Game SDK! We're glad you made it. The Game SDK helps you develop your 3rd party game or app, and integrate it with Discord.

---

## Getting Started

This section will walk you through the first few steps you need to take to get up-and-running with the Game SDK. After you download the SDK and configure your app, you can find more details in the [Using the SDK section](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/using-the-sdk).

### Step 1: Get the SDK

Now, let's get started. First, get the SDK. Here it is:

- [Discord Game SDK v3.2.1](https://dl-game-sdk.discordapp.net/3.2.1/discord_game_sdk.zip) - Latest version, includes Apple silicon (aarch64) support
- [Discord Game SDK v2.5.6](https://dl-game-sdk.discordapp.net/2.5.6/discord_game_sdk.zip) - Try this version if you encounter bugs on the latest version

There's a few things in there, but let's quickly talk about what the SDK actually _is_. Inside the `lib/` folder, you'll see `x86/` and `x86_64/` that have some `.lib`, `.bundle`, and `.dll` files. These are the things you want to distribute with your game.

These files are comprised of two parts: a "stub", and fallback modules. What that means is that when everything is running smoothly, the DLLs will just call back to the local running Discord client to do the heavy lifting. If, however, something is wrong, like a breaking change, the files also include "fallback" modules that reflect the native SDK modules in Discord at the time that version of the SDK was published. TLDR - you don't need to worry about breaking changes.

### Step 2: Create your App

Next, we need to set up the application for your game. An [app](#DOCS_RESOURCES_APPLICATION) is the base "entity" in Discord for your game.

Head over to our [developer site](https://discord.com/developers/) and create an account/log in if you haven't yet. The first thing we're going to do is create a Team. Teams are groups of developers working together on applications; you should create a team for your organization at [https://discord.com/developers/teams](https://discord.com/developers/teams). You can invite other users to join your team and work on applications together with you.

Now that your team is created, you'll want to make an application. To do so, click on "Applications" at the top of the page and create an application. Make sure you pick your newly-created team in the `Team` dropdown. You want your team to own the application! Now that your app is made, let's dive into some more setup.

> warn
> If you're integrating our SDK into an already-released game, there's a good chance that we may _already have_ an application in our database for your game! Reach out to our [Dev Support](https://dis.gd/devsupport) to learn more

First, we'll need to set an OAuth2 redirect URL. You can add `http://127.0.0.1` in there for now; this powers some behind-the-scenes stuff you don't need to worry about.

Next, copy the **Client ID** at the top of the page. This id, also referred to as an "application id", is your game's unique identifier across Discord. Keep it handy!

While you're here, head to the "OAuth2" section of your application and add `http://127.0.0.1` as a redirect URI for your application. This will allow us to do the OAuth2 token exchange within the Discord client.

### Step 3: Start Coding

Before you start developing, there are a couple of notes to keep in mind about the SDK:

- All strings in the SDK are UTF8 strings. Make sure you've converted properly if necessary!
- The SDK is **_NOT_** threadsafe!

With that out of the way, let's start coding. Didn't think we'd get there so fast, did ya? _Think again!_ The dropdowns are code primers for the main languages of the SDK: C#, C, and C++. They'll get you up and running with the most basic examples, and then you're off to the races.

<Collapsible title="Code Primer for Unity (C#)" icon="code">
- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.
- Copy the contents of the `lib/` folder to `Assets/Plugins` in your Unity project
- Copy the contents of the `csharp/` folder to `Assets/Plugins/DiscordGame SDK`

From there, you'll be able to reference functions in the DLL within your scripts. A basic example of a script can be found [in this example repo](https://github.com/msciotti/discord-game-sdk-test-apps/tree/master/cs-examples/unity-examples/Assets). In this example, we attach our `DiscordController.cs` script to the Main Camera object of the default created scene. We then instantiate the SDK with:

```cs
/*
    Grab that Client ID from earlier
    Discord.CreateFlags.Default will require Discord to be running for the game to work
    If Discord is not running, it will:
    1. Close your game
    2. Open Discord
    3. Attempt to re-open your game
    Step 3 will fail when running directly from the Unity editor
    Therefore, always keep Discord running during tests, or use Discord.CreateFlags.NoRequireDiscord
*/
var discord = new Discord.Discord(CLIENT_ID, (UInt64)Discord.CreateFlags.Default);
```

You're now free to use other functionality in the SDK! Make sure to call `discord.RunCallbacks()` in your main game loop; that's your `Update()` function.

You're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/Program.cs` in the SDK zip file.

<Collapsible title="Code Primer for Non-Unity Projects (C#)" icon="code">
- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.
- Create a folder in your project directory called `DiscordGame SDK` and copy the contents of the `csharp/` folder to it
- Build your solution then place the `.dll` in the directory of the `.exe` (either x86 or x86_64 version depending on your compile platform). If you compile for Any CPU you may need to perform additional wrapping around DLL importing (like setting the DLL directory dynamically) to make sure you load the correct DLL.

From there, you'll be able to reference functions in the DLL within your scripts. We then instantiate the SDK with:

```cs
/*
    Grab that Client ID from earlier
    Discord.CreateFlags.Default will require Discord to be running for the game to work
    If Discord is not running, it will:
    1. Close your game
    2. Open Discord
    3. Attempt to re-open your game
    Step 3 may fail when running directly from your editor
    Therefore, always keep Discord running during tests, or use Discord.CreateFlags.NoRequireDiscord
*/
var discord = new Discord.Discord(CLIENT_ID, (UInt64)Discord.CreateFlags.Default);
```

You're now free to use other functionality in the SDK! Make sure to call `discord.RunCallbacks()` in your main game loop; that's your `Update()` function.

You're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/Program.cs` in the SDK zip file.

<Collapsible title="Code Primer for Unreal Engine (C)" icon="code">
Before jumping into the C binding, a word of caution. If you are using Unreal Engine 3, or need to support an older version of Visual Studio, you may at first see some unexpected crashes due to compile configurations. The way to fix this is to wrap the include statement for the Discord Game SDK header file like so:

```c
#pragma pack(push, 8)
#include "discord_game_sdk.h"
#pragma pack(pop)
```

This should let you use the SDK without any further crashes. Now, on with the show!

- Open up that SDK zip that you downloaded.
- Copy the contents of the `lib/` folder to the best location within your project for DLLs.
- Copy the contents of the `c/` folder to your source directory
- It's dangerous to go aloneâ€”take this small code block with you (to start)!

```c
struct Application {
    struct IDiscordCore* core;
    struct IDiscordUsers* users;
};

struct Application app;
// Don't forget to memset or otherwise initialize your classes!
memset(&app, 0, sizeof(app));

struct IDiscordCoreEvents events;
memset(&events, 0, sizeof(events));

struct DiscordCreateParams params;
params.client_id = CLIENT_ID;
params.flags = DiscordCreateFlags_Default;
params.events = &events;
params.event_data = &app;

DiscordCreate(DISCORD_VERSION, &params, &app.core);
```

- Make sure to call `core->run_callbacks(core, 0)` in your game loop.

You're ready to go! Check out the rest of the documentation for more info on how to use the other pieces of the SDK. See an example of everything it can do in `examples/c/main.c` in the SDK zip file.

<Collapsible title="Code Primer for Unreal Engine 4 (C++)" icon="code">
First, you'll want to copy the header files and `.cpp` files to a folder somewhere in your project directory. For ease of a quickstart example, you can put them right inside your `Source/your-project-name` folder; I'd put them in a containing folder called something like `discord-files/`.

Second, you'll want to copy the `.dll` and `.lib` files from the `lib/x86_64` folder of the downloaded zip. These files should be put in `your-project-name/Binaries/Win64/`. For win32, take the files from `x86/` and put them, in `your-project-name/Binaries/Win32`.

Next, we need to link these files within our project so that we can reference them. If you open up your project's `.sln` file in Visual Studio, you'll find a file called `your-project-name.Build.cs`. We're going to add the following lines of code to that file:

```cpp
/*
    ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DISCORD_FILES_DIRECTORY will look something like:

    "H:\\Unreal Projects\\Game SDKtest\\Source\\Game SDKtest\\discord-files\\"

    You should get this value programmatically
*/
PublicIncludePaths.Add(ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_DISCORD_FILES_DIRECTORY)

/*
    ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_LIB_FILE will look something like:

    "H:\\Unreal Projects\\Game SDKtest\\Binaries\\Win64\\discord_game_sdk.dll.lib"

    You should get this value programmatically
*/
PublicAdditionalLibraries.Add(ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_LIB_FILE)
```

Now that we've got our new dependencies properly linked, we can reference them in our code. In this example, we're going to make a new `Pawn` class called `MyPawn`. It will look something like this:

```cpp
#include "MyPawn.h"
#include "discord-files/discord.h"

discord::Core* core{};

AMyPawn::AMyPawn()
{
  // Set this pawn to call Tick() every frame.  You can turn this off to improve performance if you don't need it.
  PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
}

// Called when the game starts or when spawned
void AMyPawn::BeginPlay()
{
  Super::BeginPlay();
  /*
      Grab that Client ID from earlier
      Discord.CreateFlags.Default will require Discord to be running for the game to work
      If Discord is not running, it will:
      1. Close your game
      2. Open Discord
      3. Attempt to re-open your game
      Step 3 will fail when running directly from the Unreal Engine editor
      Therefore, always keep Discord running during tests, or use Discord.CreateFlags.NoRequireDiscord
  */
  auto result = discord::Core::Create(461618159171141643, DiscordCreateFlags_Default, &core);
  discord::Activity activity{};
  activity.SetState("Testing");
  activity.SetDetails("Fruit Loops");
  core->ActivityManager().UpdateActivity(activity, [](discord::Result result) {

  });
}

// Called every frame
void AMyPawn::Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
  Super::Tick(DeltaTime);
  ::core->RunCallbacks();
}

// Called to bind functionality to input
void AMyPawn::SetupPlayerInputComponent(UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)
{
  Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);
}
```

Make sure you've got `core->RunCallbacks()` going every frame!

In your project folder, you'll want to make something like a "discord-files" folder, for organization. In that folder, copy all the `.h` and `.cpp` files from the zip.
You want to include all the header and source files respectively in your project

![Correct Files](cpp-files-sdk.png)

In your project settings, you'll want to include the relevant library (e.g. `discord_game_sdk.dll.lib`) as an additional dependency.

- From there, you should be able to `#include "discord-files/discord.h"`, or whatever the path to that header file is, and have access to the code.

## Using the SDK

At a high level, the Discord Game SDK has a parent class, `Discord`.

This class is in charge of the creation of a few "manager" sub-classes to interact with Discord.

### Managers

Each manager class contains its own functions and events used to interact with Discord in the context of the manager:

| Name                                                           | Description                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`ActivityManager`](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/activities) | for Rich Presence and game invites                         |
| [`OverlayManager`](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/overlay)     | for interacting with Discord's built-in overlay            |
| [`UserManager`](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/users)          | for fetching user data for a given id and the current user |

### Using Functions in the SDK

Most functions in the Discord Game SDK, uh, _function_ in a similar way. They take whatever parameters are required for the function to do its jobâ€”a user id, the requested size for an image, etc.â€”and a callback by means of a function pointer. That callback is fired when the function completes its work, letting you handle events without worrying about piping asynchronously-returned data to the right context.

Some functions behave with a normal return behavior; e.g. `RelationshipManager.Count()` just returns the number directly. Don't worry, it's outlined in the docs.

<Collapsible title="Example calling a function with our C# binding" icon="code">

```c#
var userManager = discord.GetUserManager();

// Return via callback
userManager.GetUser(290926444748734465, (Discord.Result result, ref Discord.User otherUser) =>
{
  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(otherUser.Username);
    Console.WriteLine(otherUser.Id);
  }
});


// Return normally
userManager.OnCurrentUserUpdate += () =>
{
    var currentUser = userManager.GetCurrentUser();
        Console.WriteLine(currentUser.Username);
        Console.WriteLine(currentUser.Discriminator);
        Console.WriteLine(currentUser.Id);
};
```

### Environment Variables

Discord passes a number of environment variables down to the SDK. These are accessed by various functions in the SDK and can be changed for local testing by changing the value in your local environment.

| name                   | method                                                                                                                                                  | description                                                                                                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID    | [Local Testing](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/testing-locally)                                                                                         | the locally running instance of Discord to connect to; allows you to choose between multiple running clients |
| DISCORD_ACCESS_TOKEN   | [ApplicationManager.GetOAuth2Token()](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/docs/game_sdk/Applications.md#getoauth2token)     | the connected user's bearer token                                                                            |
| DISCORD_CURRENT_LOCALE | [ApplicationManager.GetCurrentLocale()](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/docs/game_sdk/Applications.md#getcurrentlocale) | the language that Discord is in for the connected user                                                       |
| DISCORD_CURRENT_BRANCH | [ApplicationManager.GetCurrentBranch()](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/legacy-gamesdk/docs/game_sdk/Applications.md#getcurrentbranch) | the branch of the running application that the user has launched                                             |

### Error Handling

Debugging is a pain, so before we get into the meat of the SDK, we want to make sure you're prepared for when things go awry. Within the Discord core is a function called `SetLogHook()`. It takes a `level`, which is minimum level of log message you want to listen to, and a callback function:

<Collapsible title="Using SetLogHook for Error Handling in the SDK" icon="code">

```cs
public void LogProblemsFunction(Discord.LogLevel level, string message)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Discord:{0} - {1}", level, message);
}

discord.SetLogHook(Discord.LogLevel.Debug, LogProblemsFunction);
```

You should begin your integration by setting up this callback to help you debug. Helpfully, if you put a breakpoint inside the callback function you register here, you'll be able to see the stack trace for errors you run into (as long as they fail synchronously). Take the guess work out of debugging, or hey, ignore any and all logging by setting a callback that does nothing. We're not here to judge.

### Testing Locally

While integrating the Discord Game SDK, you will probably find yourself wanting to test functionality between two game clients locally, be it for networking, Rich Presence, etc.

We know that getting a test build of a game on two separate machines can be both difficult and cumbersome. So, we've got a solution for you!

<Collapsible title="How do I test locally while developing?" icon="question">

> info
> Value from environment variable `DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID`

By using system environment variables, you can tell the SDK in a certain game client to connect to a specific Discord client. Here's how it works:

1. Download Discord Canary. This is our most updated build, and is good to develop against: [Windows](https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=win) - [Mac](https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=osx)
2. Download a second Discord Build. Here's our Public Test Build: [Windows](https://discord.com/api/download/ptb?platform=win) - [Mac](https://discord.com/api/download/ptb?platform=osx)
3. Open up two Discord clients. We recommend you develop against Discord Canary, so you can use PTB or Stable for your test account
4. Log in with two separate users. Make sure any test account is added to the application's App Whitelist in the portal!

Now, in your game code, you can tell the SDK which client to connect to via the environment variable `DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID` **before initializing the SDK**. The value of the variable corresponds to the order in which you opened the clients, so `0` would connect to the first opened client, `1` the second, etc.

###### Environment Variable Example

```cs
// This machine opened Discord Canary first, and Discord PTB second

// This makes the SDK connect to Canary
System.Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID", "0");
var discord = new Discord(applicationId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);

// This makes the SDK connect to PTB
System.Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("DISCORD_INSTANCE_ID", "1");
var discord = new Discord(applicationId, Discord.CreateFlags.Default);
```

This will set the environment variable only within the context of the running process, so don't worry about messing up global stuff.

> danger
> If you test with this, make sure to remove this code before pushing a production build. It will interfere with the way that Discord launches games for users.

### Functions

#### Create

Creates an instance of Discord to initialize the SDK. This is the overlord of all things Discord. We like to call her Nelly.

Returns a new `Discord`.

###### Parameters

| name     | type        | description                                         |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| clientId | Int64       | your application's client id                        |
| flags    | CreateFlags | the creation parameters for the SDK, outlined above |

###### Example

```cpp
// c++ land
discord::Core* core{};
discord::Core::Create(53908232506183680, DiscordCreateFlags_Default, &core);

// c# land
var discord = new Discord(53908232506183680, (UInt64)Discord.CreateFlags.Default);
```

#### Destroy

Destroys the instance. Wave goodbye, Nelly! You monster. In C# land, this is `Dispose()`.

> info
> The C++ binding does not include a `destroy()` method, as the destructor for the Core does the work for you.

Returns `void`.

###### Example

```cs
discord.Dispose();
```

#### SetLogHook

Registers a logging callback function with the minimum level of message to receive. The callback function should have a signature of:

```cs
MyCallbackFunction(LogLevel level, string message);
```

Returns `void`.

###### Parameters

| name     | type     | description                                 |
|----------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| level    | LogLevel | the minimum level of event to log           |
| callback | function | the callback function to catch the messages |

###### Example

```cs
public void LogProblemsFunction(Discord.LogLevel level, string message)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Discord:{0} - {1}", level, message);
}

discord.SetLogHook(Discord.LogLevel.Debug, LogProblemFunctions);
```

#### RunCallbacks

Runs all pending SDK callbacks. Put this in your game's main event loop, like `Update()` in Unity. That way, the first thing your game does is check for any new info from Discord.

This function also serves as a way to know that the local Discord client is still connected. If the user closes Discord while playing your game, `RunCallbacks()` will return/throw `Discord.Result.NotRunning`.

In C and C++, this function returns `Discord.Result`. In C#, it returns `void` and will throw `Discord.Result` error if something went wrong.

###### Example

```cs
void Update()
{
  discord.RunCallbacks();
}
```

#### GetActivityManager

Fetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with activities in the SDK.

Returns an `ActivityManager`.

###### Example

```cs
var activityManager = discord.GetActivityManager();
```

#### GetUserManager

Fetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with users in the SDK.

Returns an `UserManager`.

###### Example

```cs
var userManager = discord.GetUserManager();
```

#### GetOverlayManager

Fetches an instance of the manager for interfacing with the overlay in the SDK.

Returns an `OverlayManager`.

###### Example

```cs
var overlayManager = discord.GetOverlayManager();
```

### Functions

#### RegisterCommand

Registers a command by which Discord can launch your game. This might be a custom protocol, like `my-awesome-game://`, or a path to an executable. It also supports any launch parameters that may be needed, like `game.exe --full-screen --no-hax`.

On macOS, due to the way Discord registers executables, your game needs to be bundled for this command to work. That means it should be a `.app`.

Returns `void`.

###### Parameters

| name    | type   | description             |
|---------|--------|-------------------------|
| command | string | the command to register |

###### Example

```cs
activityManager.RegisterCommand("my-awesome-game://run --full-screen");
```

#### RegisterSteam

Used if you are distributing this SDK on Steam. Registers your game's Steam app id for the protocol `steam://run-game-id/<id>`.

Returns `void`.

###### Parameters

| name    | type   | description              |
|---------|--------|--------------------------|
| steamId | UInt32 | your game's Steam app id |

###### Example

```cs
activityManager.RegisterSteam(1938123);
```

#### UpdateActivity

Sets a user's presence in Discord to a new activity. This has a rate limit of 5 updates per 20 seconds.

> info
> It is possible for users to hide their presence on Discord (User Settings -> Game Activity). Presence set through this SDK may not be visible when this setting is toggled off.

Returns a `Discord.Result` via callback.

###### Parameters

| name     | type     | description                   |
|----------|----------|-------------------------------|
| activity | Activity | the new activity for the user |

## Overlay

> warn
> The overlay is only supported on Windows for DirectX or OpenGL games. Linux, Mac, and games using Vulkan are not supported. [Click here for more info.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/217659737-Games-Overlay-101)

Discord comes with an awesome built-in overlay, and you may want to make use of it for your game. This manager will help you do just that! It gives you the current state of the overlay for the user, and allows you to update that state.

### Data Models

#### ActivityActionType Enum

| name     | value |
|----------|-------|
| Join     | 1     |
| Spectate | 2     |

### Functions

#### IsEnabled

Check whether the user has the overlay enabled or disabled. If the overlay is disabled, all the functionality in this manager will still work. The calls will instead focus the Discord client and show the modal there instead.

Returns a `bool`.

###### Example

<Collapsible title="IsEnabled Example" icon="code">

```cs
if (!overlaymanager.IsEnabled())
{
  Console.WriteLine("Overlay is not enabled. Modals will be shown in the Discord client instead");
}
```
</Collapsible>

#### IsLocked

Check if the overlay is currently locked or unlocked

###### Example

<Collapsible title="IsLocked Example" icon="code">

```cs
if (overlayManager.IsLocked())
{
  overlayManager.SetLocked(true, (res) =>
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Input in the overlay is now accessible again");
  });
}
```
</Collapsible>

#### SetLocked

Locks or unlocks input in the overlay. Calling `SetLocked(true);` will also close any modals in the overlay or in-app from things like IAP purchase flows and disallow input.

Returns `Discord.Result` via callback.

###### Parameters

| name   | type | description                |
|--------|------|----------------------------|
| locked | bool | lock or unlock the overlay |

###### Example

<Collapsible title="SetLocked Example" icon="code">

```cs
overlayManager.SetLocked(true, (res) =>
{
  Console.WriteLine("Overlay has been locked and modals have been closed");
});
```
</Collapsible>


#### OpenActivityInvite

Opens the overlay modal for sending game invitations to users, channels, and servers. If you do not have a valid activity with all the required fields, this call will error. See [Activity Action Field Requirements](#DOCS_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_GAME_SDK/activity-action-field-requirements) for the fields required to have join and spectate invites function properly.

Returns a `Discord.Result` via callback.

###### Parameters

| name | type               | description                 |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| type | ActivityActionType | what type of invite to send |

###### Example

<Collapsible title="OpenActivityInvite Example" icon="code">

```cs
overlayManager.OpenActivityInvite(Discord.ActivityActionType.Join, (result) =>
{
  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("User is now inviting others to play!");
  }
});
```
</Collapsible>

#### OpenGuildInvite

Opens the overlay modal for joining a Discord guild, given its invite code. An invite code for a server may look something like `fortnite` for a verified serverâ€”the full invite being `discord.gg/fortnite`â€”or something like `rjEeUJq` for a non-verified server, the full invite being `discord.gg/rjEeUJq`.

Returns a `Discord.Result` via callback. Note that a successful `Discord.Result` response does not necessarily mean that the user has joined the guild. If you want more granular control over and knowledge about users joining your guild, you may want to look into implementing the [`guilds.join` OAuth2 scope in an authorization code grant](#DOCS_TOPICS_OAUTH2/authorization-code-grant) in conjunction with the [Add Guild Members](#DOCS_RESOURCES_GUILD/add-guild-member) endpoint.

###### Parameters

| name | type   | description                |
|------|--------|----------------------------|
| code | string | an invite code for a guild |

###### Example

<Collapsible title="OpenGuildInvite Example" icon="code">

```cs
overlayManager.OpenGuildInvite("rjEeUJq", (result) =>
{
  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Invite was valid.");
  }
});
```
</Collapsible>

#### OpenVoiceSettings

Opens the overlay widget for voice settings for the currently connected application. These settings are unique to each user within the context of your application. That means that a user can have different favorite voice settings for each of their games!

<Collapsible title="Screenshot of the Voice Settings modal for an application" icon="view">

![Screenshot of the Voice Settings modal for an application](game-overlay-sdk-voice-settings.png)
</Collapsible>

Returns a `Discord.Result` via callback.

###### Example

```cs
overlayManager.OpenVoiceSettings((result) =>
{
  if (result == Discord.Result.Ok)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Overlay is open to the voice settings for your application/")
  }
})
```
</Collapsible>

#### OnToggle

Fires when the overlay is locked or unlocked (a.k.a. opened or closed)

###### Parameters

| name   | type | description                           |
|--------|------|---------------------------------------|
| locked | bool | is the overlay now locked or unlocked |

###### Example

<Collapsible title="OnToggle Example" icon="code">

```cs
overlayManager.OnToggle += overlayLock =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Overlay Locked: {0}", overlayLock);
};
```
