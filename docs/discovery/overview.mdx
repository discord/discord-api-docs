## Social Discovery

Once your app is discoverable, there are several ways users may find it through social interactions in Discord. Users may discover your app through other users using it. When your app is used in a server, it may be visible to other users in the server, allowing users to learn more about it and install it themselves from your app's profile.

### Sharing Links

Create shareable links to your app's profile page, store page, or specific items. Share these links in Discord, emails, or on your website.
