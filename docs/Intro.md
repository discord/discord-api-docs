## Applications (aka Apps)

Making an app on Discord opens up many possibilities for deeper integrations with your other services and platforms.
Here are some examples to whet your appetite:

* Using your Discord account to safely login to your guild's website
* Display who’s online or in-game on your website or forum
* Automatically join private Discord servers or gain new roles based on external website permissions
* Other neat things.

Head over to our new [applications page](#MY_APPLICATIONS/top) to dive into creating your own custom juice.


### Airhorn Solutions - Bot #0

On April 1st we launched [Airhorn Solutions](https://airhorn.solutions) to bring chaos upon this meek world.

Now that the noise has subsided, we’ve [open-sourced the source code for Airhorn Solutions](https://github.com/hammerandchisel/airhornbot). It’s the first fully-functional bot built with our initial API launch. If you’re looking for a working example of our API, we highly suggest digging in.


## Games (aka Games)

GameBridge is a free SDK that lets you power your desktop game's social features with Discord. Check out some of the
tasty flavors GameBridge offers:

* Add low latency voice and text chat to your game.
* Let your players share fancy moments including screenshots and links.
* Show chat from your game's Discord community directly on your main menu.
* Use servers for your game's guild chat extending it into the Discord experience.

For now GameBridge is in private beta. If you're interested in trying out Discord to power your game please [sign up over here](https://discordapp.com/gamebridge).

There is also an [active unofficial community-driven Discord Server for devs](https://discord.gg/discord-api). Come hang out if you wanna chat with other devs and see what’s being cranked out.

We look forward to seeing what you make!
